</div>

<p>This work completes the series of historical textbooks
which I began more than thirty years ago. It is an expansion
of a course of lectures given for several years to my
advanced classes in history, and is designed as a brief introduction
to the history of morals. In treating the science of
morals as a branch of history my thought is, without trenching
in the least upon the domain of the philosophy of morals, to
make the work of the department of history more helpfully
introductory than it has hitherto been to that of the department
of moral philosophy. The book is the outgrowth of a
conviction that the philosophy of ethics, if it shall become a
stimulus and guide to social service and humanitarian effort,—especially
if it shall bring reënforcement to that ethical
idealism which so largely motives the present-day movement
for world peace,—must be based on a knowledge of the facts
of the moral life of the race in all the various stages of the
historic evolution, and that to gather and systematize these
facts is a part of the task of the historian, indeed the most
important part of his task. It is my hope that teachers of
both history and ethics may find the book helpful, whether
made the basis of classroom discussion or of lecture comment.</p>

<p>Ethics gives to History its rational goal; and all morality has the perfect
shaping of universal history as its ultimate end. A real understanding of
history is not possible without ethics; universal history is the realization
of the moral ... within humanity.—<span class="smcap">Adolf Wuttke.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The real advance made by Thucydides consists, perhaps, in this, that he
perceived the motive forces of human history to be in the moral constitution
of human nature.—<span class="smcap">Leopold von Ranke.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ethics, if it is to become truly a science, must shun the path of speculation
and follow closely the historical method.... Range in fancy over
the whole circle of the sciences, and you will find there no place for
ethics save as a branch of human history.... Given the earliest morality
of which we have any written record, to trace from it through progressive
stages the morality of to-day; that is the problem, and the only problem
which can fall to a truly scientific ethics.... Ethics as the comparative
history of universal morality is the vestibule to the temple of moral
philosophy.—<span class="smcap">Jacob Gould Schurman.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethical interpretation of history</div>

<p>Professor Freeman defined history as “past politics.” Mr.
Buckle argued that the essence of the historical evolution consists
in intellectual progress.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Many present-day economists
hold that the dominant forces in the historical development
are economic.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Churchmen consistently make the chief factor
in history to be religion.</p>

<p>Whether the upholders of these several interpretations of
history would have us understand them as speaking of the
ultimate goal of the historic evolution, or merely of the dominant
motive under which men and society act, none of these
interpretations can be accepted by the student of the facts of
the moral life of the race as a true reading of history. To
him not only does moral progress constitute the very essence
of the historic movement, but the ethical motive presents itself
as the most constant and regulative force in the evolution
of humanity. His chief interest in all the other factors
of the historical evolution is in noting in what way and in
what measure they have contributed to the growth and
enrichment of the moral life of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>Thus the historian of morals is deeply interested in the
growth of political institutions among men, but chiefly in
observing in what way these institutions have affected for
good or for evil the moral life of the nation. Particularly is
the progress of the world toward political unity a matter of
profound concern to him, not because he regards the establishment
of the world state as an end in itself, but because
the universal state alone can furnish those conditions under
which the moral life of humanity can most freely expatiate
and find its noblest and truest expression.</p>

<p>It is the same with intellectual progress. The student of
morals recognizes the fact that the progress of the race in
morality is normally dependent upon its progress in knowledge—that
conscience waits upon the intellect. But in opposition
to Buckle and those of his school, he maintains that,
so far from an advance in knowledge constituting the essence
of a progressive civilization, this mental advance constitutes
merely the condition precedent of real civilization, the distinctive
characteristic of which must be a true morality. A
civilization or culture which does not include this is doomed
to quick retrogression and decay. As Benjamin Kidd truly
observes, “When the intellectual development of any section
of the race, for the time being, outruns the ethical development,
natural selection has apparently weeded it out like any
other unsuitable product.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>As with the political and intellectual elements of civilization
so is it with the economic. The outward forms of the
moral life are, it is true, largely determined by the industry
of a people; but the informing spirit of morality is the expression
of an implanted faculty. It is elicited but not created
by environment. No industrial order from which it is lacking
can long endure. Natural selection condemns it as unfit.
And this we are beginning to recognize—that economics
and ethics cannot be divorced, that every great industrial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
problem is at bottom a moral problem. To the student of the
ethical phase of history all social reformers from the old
Hebrew prophets down to Karl Marx and Henry George
are primarily moralists pleading for social justice, equity,
and righteousness.</p>

<p>And preëminently the same is it with religion. Religion
has been a great part of the life of man, and the historian of
morals must be a diligent student of the religious systems
of the world, but mainly because religion has been in general
such a potent agency in the moral education of mankind.
For it is the ethical factor in the great world religions which
constitutes their universal and permanent element. “It is
the function of religion to kindle moral enthusiasm in society
at large.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> “Christianity has no other function or value than
as an aid to morality.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> All the great religions of the world—Buddhism,
Confucianism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism (reckoning
historic Judaism as beginning with the great prophets of the
ninth and eighth centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), Christianity, and Islam—began
as moral reforms.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>In short, in the words of Wellhausen, “Morality is that
for the sake of which all other things exist; it is the alone
essential thing in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The really constructive and
regulative forces in history are in truth moral ideas and convictions.
And there is vast significance in this—that the
ethical motive, never absent and always active, is constantly
becoming more and more dominant in the processes of the
historical evolution. As the ages pass there enters into history—we
shall see this to be so later—an ever larger ethical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
element. Conscience becomes ever more and more involved in
the personal, national, and international affairs of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The history of morals in the main a record of the expansion of the circle covered by the moral feelings</div>

<p>Moral progress consists not so much in changes in the
quality or intensity of the moral emotions, although these
gain in diversity, purity, and refinement as time passes, as
in the successive enlargements of the circle of persons embraced
by the moral feelings.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> “It is not the sense of duty
to a neighbor, but the practical answer to the question, Who
is my neighbor? that has varied.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> As we shall see when
we come to examine the morality of primitive man, the moral
feelings embrace at first only kinsmen, that is, the members
of one’s own family, clan, or social group. All others are outside
the moral pale. But gradually this circle grows larger
and embraces in successive expansions the tribe, the city, the
nation, and lastly humanity.</p>

<p>This expansion of the area covered by the moral feelings
is the dominant fact in the moral history of mankind. It is
the overlooking of this fact that has caused writers like Buckle
to make their strange misreading of history and to maintain
that though man during historic times has made immense
progress on material and intellectual lines, he has made little
or no progress in morality. The truth is, as we shall learn, that
in no domain has progress been greater, the gains larger or
more precious, than in the moral. From clan morality, based
on physical kinship, mankind has advanced or is advancing to
world morality, based on the ethical kinship of men. This is
the one increasing purpose running through all history—the
creation of a moral order embracing the whole human race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources for the history of morals</div>

<p>The facts for a history of morals must be sought chiefly
outside the literature of ethical theory and speculation. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
must be looked for in the customs, laws, institutions, mythologies,
literatures, maxims, and religions of the different
races, peoples, and ages of history.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> In all these there is
always an ethical element; often this forms their very essence.
“In every sentence of the penal code,” as the moralist Wilhelm
Wundt remarks, “there speaks the voice of an objective
moral conscience.” In truth all law codes, whether civil
or criminal, are essentially nothing more nor less than the
embodiment of man’s conceptions of what is just and unjust.
Mythologies, literatures, and philosophies are charged with
moral sentiment. In religion there struggle for utterance the
deepest moral feelings and convictions of the human soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral ideal</div>

<p>The moral life fulfills itself in many ways. Every age and
every race has its own moral type or ideal.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> This, as we shall
use the term, may be defined as a group of virtues held in
esteem by a given people or a given age. It is the accepted
standard of conduct, of excellence, of character. This ideal
may be a very simple thing, embracing only a few rudimentary
virtues, as in the case of peoples on the lower levels of
culture; or it may be a very complex thing, embracing many
and refined virtues, as in the case of civilized societies in which
the mutual relationships of the members are many and various.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>The history of morals is in the main an account of moral
ideals or types.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Indeed so large is the part that these have
played in the growth and decay of races and civilizations that
universal history may be defined quite accurately as “the
paleontology of moral ideals.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>There is one thing about a moral ideal which sets it apart
from all other ideals. It possesses a unique dynamic force.
All ideals, it is true, have in them the impulsion to their embodiment
in reality. But in a moral ideal there is the added
imperative of conscience. There speaks from it the majestic
voice of duty, demanding that the ideal be made actual in the
life of the individual and of society. It is this that has made
moral ideals such molding and constructive forces in history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composite moral ideals or types</div>

<p>There is a striking analogy between the different types of
moral character and the different types of human beauty.
Thus corresponding to the great types of masculine and feminine
beauty there are masculine and feminine types of moral
excellence. And then, just as the elements of the two chief
types of feminine beauty, the blond and the brunette, combine
to form a great variety of mixed or composite types, so
do the elements of the chief types of goodness blend into
many composite types of character.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>There is no more instructive chapter in the history of
morals than that which has to do with the formation of these
composite ethical types, since these are often the most significant
results of those great race collisions and comminglings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
which make up so much of the history of the past; for when
races meet and mingle they blend not only their blood but
also their consciences. There appears not only a new physical
man but also a new moral man.</p>

<p>Thus the fusion of races in Europe has resulted in a great
fusion of moralities. The conscience of Europe is a very composite
one, including Greek, Roman, Hebraic, Celtic, Gothic,
and Slavonic elements. This heterogeneous conscience, so
different, for instance, from the comparatively homogeneous
conscience of ancient Egypt and of China, has been the most
important factor in the life and civilization of the European
people. It is largely because Europe has been constantly getting
a new conscience that its history has been so disturbed
and so progressive, just as it is largely because China has had
the same Confucian conscience for two thousand years and
more, that her history has been so uneventful and unchanging.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes which determine and which modify the moral type</div>

<p>Though every race and every age, since man is by nature a
moral being, must have some type or standard of moral goodness,
still the cast and content of this type is determined by a
great variety of circumstances, such as the stage of intellectual
development, the physical environment, social and political
institutions, occupation, and speculative and religious ideas.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>The stage of intellectual development of a given society
determines in general whether the moral standard shall be
high or low. Peoples still on the level of savagery must
necessarily have a very simple moral code, embracing only a
few rudimentary virtues. As a people or race progresses in
intelligence and the mental horizon widens, the moral sense
becomes clarified and the moral standard comes to embrace
new and refined virtues, corresponding to the larger and truer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
mental life; for, speaking broadly, there is a general coincidence
between intellectual and moral growth. To create a
new intellectual life is to create a new moral life.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Physical environment is also a potent agency in determining
the cast of the moral type. Thus the hot depressing
climate and the prodigality of nature in the tropics foster
the passive, quietistic virtues; while the harsher and more
grudging nature of the temperate regions favors the development
of the active, industrial virtues. The strongly contrasted
moral types of the peoples of the tropic regions of the earth
and those of the temperate lands may without reasonable doubt
be ascribed, in part at least, to differences in the climatic and
other physical influences to which these peoples have been
subjected through long periods of time.</p>

<p>More positively influential in the formation of moral ideas
and feelings are social institutions. Thus the place which a
whole group of moral qualities that we designate as domestic
virtues are assigned in the ethical standard is determined by
the place which circumstances may have given the family in
the social organism. In ancient Sparta, for example, where
certain influences subordinated the family in an unusual degree
to the state, the family virtues held a very low place, indeed
scarcely any place at all, in the moral ideal; while in China,
where certain notions of the relation of the spirits of the dead
members of the family to its living members created a remarkable
solidarity of the family group, the domestic virtues, and
among them preëminently the virtue of filial piety, came to
determine the entire cast of the general ideal of goodness.</p>

<p>Government is another potent agency in molding the moral
type. Patriarchal monarchy and popular government tend
each to nourish a distinct morality, so that we speak of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
ethics of monarchy and the ethics of democracy. As time
passes, governments, speaking broadly, become constantly
more and more ethical in aim and purpose, and hence act
more and more dynamically upon the moral evolution. The
greatest force making for a truer and higher morality in the
world to-day is political democracy.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>More effective than any of the agencies thus far mentioned
in determining the moral code of a people is occupation.
“Man’s character,” as the economist Alfred Marshall truly
affirms, “has been molded by his everyday work ... more
than by any other influence unless it be that of his religious
ideals.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Every occupation develops a characteristic group
of virtues. This is especially true of agriculture. “The cultivation
of the soil,” says Wedgwood, “cultivates much
besides—it molds ideals, implants aspirations, creates permanent
tendencies. It gives, where it is the predominant
industry, to the character of a people its moral stamp.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Finally we mention religion as the most potent of all agencies
in the molding of the moral type.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Religion has been the
great schoolmaster in the moral education of the race. It is
true that religion has to go to school itself in morals before it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
can become a schoolmaster. That is to say, religion in its beginnings
is in the main unethical. In its lower manifestations
it is hardly more than a system of incantations and sorcery.
One of the most important facts of the moral history of the
race is the gradual moralization of man’s at first unethical
conception of the gods, and the rise out of the unethical religions
of primitive times of the great ethical world religions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In what virtue or moral goodness consists</div>

<p>Having defined ethical ideals and noted the agencies determining
their cast and content, we may now seek an answer,
in terms of the ethical ideal, to the question, In what does
moral goodness consist? All the truly great seers and moral
teachers of the race have here the same word for us, and it is
this: Do the thing thou seest to be good; realize thy ideal.
In the words of Sabatier, “The essential thing in the world is
not to serve this ideal or that, but with all one’s soul to serve
the ideal which one has chosen.” Such loyalty to one’s ideal
is moral goodness.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> This imperative of conscience that one
be true and loyal to the best one knows is the only thing absolute
and categorical in the utterance of the moral faculty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Every age must be judged by its own moral standard</div>

<p>“A man must learn a great deal,” says Marcus Aurelius,
“to enable him to pass a correct judgment on another man’s
acts.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> And among the things which he must first learn is
this—that the men of every age have their own standard of
excellence and that they can be judged fairly only by their own
code of morals.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> It is largely because of the general ignorance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
of the history of moral ideals that there is so much uncharitableness
in the world, so much intolerance, so much race
prejudice and hatred. As one’s intellectual outlook broadens,
as he becomes acquainted with the various types of goodness
of different peoples and different ages, he becomes more liberal
and charitable in his moral judgments, since he comes
to understand that moral character is determined not by the
ideal of conduct but by the way in which this ideal is lived
up to. “There may be as genuine self-devotion,” declares the
moralist Professor Green, “in the act of the barbarian warrior
who gives his life that his tribe may win a piece of land
from its neighbors, as in that of the missionary who dies in
carrying the gospel to the heathen.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Studying the ideals of races and epochs in the spirit of
these words, we shall make some fruitful discoveries. We
shall learn for one thing that since the beginning of the truly
ethical age there has ever been about the same degree of conscientiousness
in the world; that the different ages, viewed in
respect to their moral life, have differed chiefly in the degree
of light they have enjoyed, and consequently in their conceptions
of what is noblest in conduct, of what constitutes duty,
not in their fealty or lack of fealty to their chosen standard
of excellence. That is to say, speaking broadly, the majority
of men in every age and in every land have ever followed
loyally the right as they have been given to see the right.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
“If men and times were really understood,” the historian
Von Holst truly observes, “the moral fault of their follies
and crimes will almost always appear diminished by one half.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DAWN OF MORALITY: CONSCIENCE IN THE
KINSHIP GROUP</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_12a">I. <span class="smcap">Institutions, Ideas, and Conditions of Life
determining the Rules of Conduct</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The kinship group</div>

<p>The most important social product of the human evolution
on the lower levels of civilization was the patriarchal family or
clan. This community of kinsfolk is the great history-making
group. It was the seed plot and nursery not only of almost
every social and political institution of the historic peoples,
but of their morality as well. In the bosom of this group were
born and nurtured the chief of those affections and sentiments
into which enters an ethical element and which form the basis
of the moral life.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The fundamental bond uniting this group was the bond of
blood. The members of the group were, or believed themselves
to be, the actual descendants of a common ancestor. It was
this tie of blood, this physical relationship real or assumed,
that rendered the clan such a closely knit body and created
its feeling of corporate oneness. “The members of one kindred,”
says W. Robertson Smith in describing this characteristic
of the Semitic clan, “looked on themselves as one living
whole, a single animated mass of blood, flesh, and bones,
of which no member could be touched without all the members
suffering.... If one of the clan has been murdered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
they say ‘Our blood has been shed.’”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Compared with this
sense of solidarity as it is found among certain of the negro
clans in Africa, the feeling of solidarity of the family among
European peoples “is thin and feeble.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>It was this corporate consciousness of the primitive clan
that created its moral solidarity. It naturally called into existence
those altruistic sentiments that formed the ground out
of which grew man’s earliest feelings of moral obligation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The religious bond&#8203;— &#8203;ancestor worship</div>

<p>There was a second bond uniting the members of the kinship
group. They were united not only by the ties of physical
kinship but also by the bonds of a common cult. This was
the worship of ancestors. To realize the ethical educative
value of this worship we must recall the remarkable constitution
of the clan. This group of kinsmen has a visible and an
invisible side. There are the earthly members of the group
and the spirit members—the souls of the dead. These
spirit members are the protectors of the little group, the punishers
of wrongdoing, the conservators of morals. Among
the most sacred duties of the earthly members are the duties
they owe to these spirit members; for these spirits have need
of many things, especially of meat and drink at the grave, and
it is the duty of their earthly kinsmen to supply all these wants.
The earth group is thus enveloped in a sort of sacred atmosphere,
and in this atmosphere are nurtured those ethical
sentiments which form the most precious product of history.</p>

<p>As an agency in the moralizing of the life of the race it
would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of ancestor
worship. To no other form of religion, save ethical monotheism,
does morality owe so large a debt. In this cult religion
and morality are at one almost at the outset,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> whereas in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
nature cults, or the cults of nature gods, it is generally only at
a late period that these elements are united. It was this cult
of ancestors which formed the basis of an essential part of
the morality of the Greeks and Romans, particularly the latter,
at the first appearance of these peoples in history, and which
to-day, as the chief religion of the Chinese, Japanese, and
other peoples of the Far East, fosters the best virtues of a
third of the human race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conceptions of the god world</div>

<p>Another influence determining the moral code of primitive
man is his ideas of the god world. It is true that the conceptions
formed of the gods by the untutored mind are for
the most part crude and unethical. But man ever makes and
remakes his gods in his own image; therefore as soon as an
ethical element begins to enter into his own life he begins to
moralize the character of his gods. At this stage the god world
begins to react favorably upon the moral life of man. The gods
are now conceived as taking notice of the conduct of men and
as approving certain acts as right and disapproving certain
other acts as wrong. Especially are they believed to punish
atrocious crimes, such as the slaying of a kinsman and the
breaking of the word sworn by the oath-god. In this way primitive
man’s ideas of deity react favorably upon his morality.</p>

<p>The gods further advance morality by being invoked as the
witnesses and guardians of treaties between clans and tribes.
By thus giving an added sanctity to solemn engagements
mutually entered into by communities they widen the moral
domain and become the promoters of intertribal morality.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The fact that competition is between communities and not between individuals</div>

<p>In nothing perhaps does primitive society differ more
widely from modern than in the fact that the competition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
or struggle for existence is between communities and not
between individuals. Within the kinship group life is almost
wholly communistic. There is practically no competition between
the individuals of the community such as characterizes
societies advanced in civilization. The only real competition
is that between communities. And here the struggle for
existence or for superiority is generally habitual and ruthless,
often being carried to the point of the complete destruction
of one of the competing communities.</p>

<p>These conditions of existence have vast significance for
morality. Just as the individual competition in cultured societies
molds an essential part of their moral code, so does
the group competition of races still in the clan or tribal stage
of civilization determine what qualities of character shall be
developed among them. As we shall see in a moment, it
makes them strong in the clan virtues.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_15">II. <span class="smcap">Essential Facts of Kinship or Intratribal
Morality</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The life of primitive peoples largely unmoral</div>

<p>As students of morals our chief interest in primeval man
as he emerges from the obscurity of prehistoric times is not
concerning the degree of skill he has developed in making
his weapons or in constructing for himself a shelter, nor
concerning what advance he has made in the arts of weaving
and pottery, nor yet concerning what kind of social arrangements
he has worked out; our main interest in this primeval
man as he appears on the threshold of the historic day is not
concerning these or any like things, but rather respecting what
kind of a conscience has grown up within him during those
long prehistoric ages of struggle, privation, watch and ward.</p>

<p>The first fact that compels our notice here is that the life
of the savage is largely <em>un</em>moral.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> His activities to secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
food, shelter, and clothing arise from purely animal impulses,
such as hunger and cold. Into all of these activities, however,
there enters as time passes an ethical element.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The
economic life, in a word, comes more and more under the
dominance of moral feelings and motives.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Conscience becomes
more and more involved in all these matters. This
gradual moralization of these at first nonmoral activities of
primitive man constitutes one of the most important phases
of the moral evolution of the race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “goodness” of uncivilized races largely a negative goodness</div>

<p>A second fact in the moral life of savages that claims our
attention is that much that is counted unto them for “goodness”
is a purely negative goodness. Failure in discrimination
here often results in a wrong estimate of their morality
as compared with that of advanced communities. Thus in
portraying the manners and customs of primitive peoples,
some writers, like Tacitus in his account of the early German
folk, laud their morals as superior to those of civilized
men. This opinion is based rather on the absence among
such peoples of the usual vices and crimes of civilized societies
than on the practice by them of the higher positive
virtues.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> But the absence of the vices which characterize
civilization is to be explained, of course, by the simpler organization
of society and the fewer temptations to wrongdoing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Thus the single circumstance that the institution of individual
property has not yet come into existence, or at least has not as
yet received any great extension, accounts for the comparative
absence of crimes against property, which constitute probably
the greater number of criminal acts in civilized society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The true starting point of the historic ethical development</div>

<p>But notwithstanding that so much of the life of primitive
man is lived on the nonmoral plane, and that much which is
reckoned unto him for goodness is merely negative goodness,
still in certain of his activities growing out of his clan relationships
we discover the beginnings of all human morality.
For as we have already said, the true starting point of the
moral evolution of mankind is to be sought in the altruistic
sentiments nourished in the atmosphere of the kinship group.
There is scarcely an ethical sentiment which does not appear
here at least in a rudimentary form. Out of the most sacred
and intimate relationships of the group we find springing up
the maternal virtues of patience, tenderness, and self-denial,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
and the filial virtues of love, obedience, and reverence; out
of the fellowship of the men in hunting and in war<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> we see
developing the manly virtues of courage, fortitude, self-control,
and, above all, self-devotion to the common good; out of the
hearth worship of ancestors<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> we observe springing up many
of those religious-ethical feelings and sentiments which form
one of the chief moral forces in civilization; out of the sacrificial
meal shared with the gods and the spirits of the dead
through offerings of portions of the food and drink, we see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
forming customs of incalculable moral value in the ethical
training of the race.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> A great part of the history of morals
consists in the record of how these earliest forms of social
virtues, first nourished by the customs, habits, and practices of
the kinship group, have been gradually refined and developed
into wider and richer forms of ethical sentiment and feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Custom as the maker of group morality</div>

<p>There is one special feature of this germinal morality to
which our attention must now be directed. It is what is often
called customary morality. That is to say, the standard of
right and wrong in the kinship community is custom. Custom
is the lawgiver, and morality consists in following custom.
The individual, in a word, follows the tribal or group conscience
rather than the dictates of his own conscience. Indeed
there is practically no such thing here as a private conscience.
Individualism has not yet arisen. No one ordinarily has private
notions of right and wrong which he feels impelled to set up
against the immemorial customs and usages of the community.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>But there is really nothing in this fact which sets this nascent
morality apart from our own. It differs from ours not in kind
but only in degree. The morality of the masses is still largely
customary morality. Most persons in their social relations, in
business, and in religion, follow unthinkingly the tribal conscience,
that is, the conventional morality of the society of which
they are members, rather than their own individual sense of right
and wrong. “Reflective morality” is still the morality of the
few. The ever-renewed moral task of man is to change the customary
tribal conscience into a reflective individual conscience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Collective responsibility</div>

<p>There is still another phase of the incipient morality of
the kinship group which claims our attention because of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
significance for the history of the evolution of morals. It is
a group morality, that is, a morality based on the idea of collective
responsibility.</p>

<p>This conception presents one of the most striking phenomena
in the history of the moral evolution of mankind. Among
peoples in the earlier stages of moral development the family
or clan group rather than the individual is regarded as the ethical
unit, and the act of any member of this group, when such
act concerns a member or members of another social group,
is looked upon as the act of the whole body to which he belongs.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
For the wrongdoing of one all are held responsible.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>This group morality, with which the true history of the unfolding
moral consciousness of the race begins, we shall meet
with as a sort of survival in every stage of the moral progress
of humanity from the lowest to the highest level of culture.
“It is,” in the words of Hobhouse, “one of the dominant
facts, if not <em>the</em> dominant fact, ethically considered, in the
evolution of human society.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> The account of that slow
change in the moral consciousness of man which has gradually
caused group morality, in most spheres of life and thought,
to give place to individual morality, that is, to that conception
of moral responsibility which holds every man responsible for
his own act, and only for his own act, makes up one of the
most instructive chapters in the moral history of the world.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
We shall find significant survivals of this idea of collective
responsibility, particularly in the religious domain. In truth,
a large part of religious history is nothing more nor less than
an account of the influence and outworkings of this notion.
Men making their gods like unto themselves have imagined
them as acting on this principle of communal responsibility,
and as bringing upon a whole people pestilence, famine, war,
or other calamity in revenge or punishment for some neglect
in worship or act of sacrilege on the part of perhaps a single
member of the tribe or nation.</p>

<p>By the early Fathers of the Church this idea of collective
responsibility, embodied in the doctrine of the imputation of
the guilt of the transgression of the first man Adam to all
his descendants to the end of the world, was given a prominent
place in Christian theology and has been a great force
in molding the morality of the Western world.</p>

<p>Again, we find this idea of group morality embodied in the
war ethics of the modern nations, which, regarded from one
point of view, is largely group ethics, that is to say, the survival
in the domain of international relations of ethical ideas
that had their birth on the low intellectual and moral levels
of barbarism.</p>

<p>As we follow the upward trend of the lines of the moral
evolution of the race we shall hear louder and louder protests
against this notion of communal responsibility, especially
when this form of human morality has been transferred to
the heavens and made a fundamental principle of the divine
government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duty of revenge; the blood feud</div>

<p>In primitive society if a man slay a kinsman, he is punished
by outlawry, that is, by expulsion from the family or
clan.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> The story of Cain, the first murderer of a kinsman in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Hebrew legend, is typical.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> If, however, a member of a clan
is slain by an outsider, it is the duty of the nearest kinsman
of the person killed, or of the collective body of his kinsfolk,
to kill in revenge the slayer or some relative of his.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> To
ignore this obligation or to forgive the slayer of one’s kinsman
is regarded as base and cowardly.</p>

<p>As, through the advance of society, the ties of the clan
become relaxed and this group becomes more and more perfectly
merged with the larger group of the tribe or state of
which it has become a part, and justice comes to be administered
by the tribal head or by regular tribunals, then blood revenge
on the part of the kinsmen of the slain gradually ceases
to be a duty and private vengeance becomes a crime. But this
is a slow evolution, and within societies far advanced in civilization
we often find belated groups still following with good
conscience the ancient custom of blood revenge. The vendetta
in Italy and the feud in some sections of our Southern states<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
are survivals or degenerate forms of this primitive virtue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Lex talionis</i></div>

<p>Closely related to the punishment of homicide in primitive
society is punishment of lesser offenses, especially the infliction
of bodily injury, within the social group. Here, too, private
vengeance rules. The person wronged or injured inflicts
such punishment upon the offender as passion or resentment
may dictate. As time passes, however, and the sense of justice
grows more discriminating, there are limits set to this private
vengeance. There is established what is called the rule
of equivalence. The avenger is not allowed to wreak upon
the offender indiscriminate and unmeasured punishment, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
is restricted to the infliction upon him of exactly such injury
and pain as he has inflicted upon his victim. Hence arose
the <i>Lex talionis</i>, limb for limb, eye for eye, and tooth for
tooth.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> This regulation thus registers an advance in moral
feeling, and may be regarded as probably the first rule of the
criminal code of the nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The virtue of courage; its altruistic element</div>

<p>In early society those virtues are most highly esteemed
which are of service to the clan or tribe. Thus courage
comes to hold a first place among the virtues. What is
especially important to be noted here is that under courage
is hidden the virtue of self-sacrifice, which we give the highest
place in our ideal of character. It is this altruistic element
in courage which lends to it its real ethical quality. In primitive
society this virtue finds expression chiefly in the ready
self-devotion of the individual in battle for the common good.</p>

<p>Throughout pagan antiquity this virtue held a central place
in practically every ideal of excellence. In the words of
Robertson Smith, “This devotion to the common weal was,
as every one knows, the mainspring of ancient morality and
the source of all the heroic virtues of which ancient history
presents so many illustrious examples.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_22">III. <span class="smcap">The Beginnings of Intertribal Morality</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive man’s double standard of morality</div>

<p>The accounts given by travelers and observers of the morals
of savages often present a perplexing contrariety of opinion.
Some writers represent such people as absolutely without a
moral sense, while others, as has already been remarked, hold
them up as models for imitation by ourselves.</p>

<p>This contrariety in view results in part from an overlooking
of the fact, just pointed out, that the moral goodness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the savage is largely a negative goodness, but chiefly from a
failure to observe that the shield has two sides, that is to say,
that savages have a double standard of morality—one standard
regulating conduct within the social group, and another
regulating conduct toward outsiders. Thus the command,
“Thou shalt not kill,” means to the savage merely that he
shall not kill a kinsman. It has in his mind no application to
strangers, just as in our minds it has no application to animals.</p>

<p>It is the same in regard to lying. Savages in general have
a high regard for truthfulness, as they understand this virtue.
The plighted word among them is probably as sacredly kept
as by the average of civilized men.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The repute of many
savage folk for untruthfulness comes about from the fact that
they do not think that a stranger has any right to the truth.
“Among themselves,” writes Professor Starr of certain Congo
tribes, “lying is not commended and truth is appreciated; but
to deceive a stranger or a white man is commendable.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>And so it is with stealing. Many uncivilized peoples are
charged, and in a certain sense rightly, with making of theft
a virtue. But it must be borne in mind that to the savage all
persons not members of his own group are strangers and
enemies. To steal from such is looked upon as a most
praiseworthy exploit, while to steal from the members of
one’s own group is regarded as a crime.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">This dual morality a survival in civilization</div>

<p>Now the important thing to note here is that this double
morality is not something peculiar to the ethics of savages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
This dualism runs through the whole moral history of the
race, from the beginning to the present day, and constitutes
one of the most important facts in the moral evolution of
humanity. We too, like the savage, have our double standard
of morality. The chief difference between us and the savage
is this: he puts his double standard in practice all the time,
we only occasionally. On occasion we fling aside our ordinary
standard of morality, lift the savage’s war standard, and then
like the savage lie and steal and kill—outside the tribe. To
deceive the stranger now is commendable; to steal from him
proper and right; to kill him a glorious exploit.</p>

<p>The great task of this century is to put an end to this
scandal of civilization, to teach men the oneness and universality
of the moral law, to get them to understand that right
and wrong are right and wrong everywhere—outside the
tribe as well as within.</p>

<p>The history of intertribal or international morality, then, is
the record of its gradual assimilation to intratribal morality.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
It is a record of how the stranger, the outsider, has come, or
is coming, to be regarded as a kinsman, as a neighbor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hospitality, or the guest right; the first step beyond kinship morality<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></div>

<p>The duty of hospitality, to which a high place is assigned
in the code of primitive peoples, shows morality taking a step,
the first step, beyond the narrow circle of the original group
of kinsmen. As we have seen, in the beginning the feeling
of duty and obligation is restricted to the little group of fellow
clansmen or tribesmen. Every one outside this social circle
is an enemy, and is without rights. But necessity forces men
to go beyond the limits of their own clan or tribe, and in time
there grows up a rule that the defenseless stranger shall be
kindly received, entertained for a certain period, and then
allowed to depart unharmed. It is easy to see how among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
clans scattered thinly over a wide territory, and where the
earlier isolation is beginning to be broken by trade relations,
this duty of hospitality should come to be regarded as a very
sacred one, and the person of the stranger guest as inviolable.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>Thus in the development of the guest right we see morality
broadening, the circle of moral obligation enlarged, and
the stranger, ordinarily counted as an enemy and as rightless,
brought for a moment within the sacred pale of ethical sentiment
and duty.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> A new ground of moral obligation other
than that of kinship has been established. Morality is now
something more than clan morality. We witness the rise of
intertribal morality. The first step in the moral unification
of the human race has been taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginnings of the ethics of war</div>

<p>Even in the domain of war we discover traces of the
awakening of an intertribal conscience in races that are
still in what we may regard as the kinship stage of culture.
Speaking broadly, primitive man, whose chief occupations
are hunting and fighting,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> makes no distinction between war
and the hunt. All persons not belonging to his own group
are regarded by him just as he regards wild game. In his
efforts to kill or capture them, all means are right. Once in
his power, he may do with them as he likes; he may make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
slaves of them, he may torture them, or he may eat their
flesh as he would that of animals taken in the chase. Conscience
lays upon him not the least restraint. Only slowly do
the moral feelings make conquests in this province.</p>

<p>One of the earliest mitigations of the barbarities of primitive
warfare is probably to be found in the discontinuance of
the practice of eating the bodies of the slain.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> It is this practice
of cannibalism as a concomitant of war by peoples in the
earlier stages of their development that perhaps more than
any other circumstance gives such a repellent aspect to human
life on the lower levels of culture. But as Montaigne observes,
the wrong consists in killing men, not in eating them after
they are dead<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>—a very just observation, and one which should
awaken reflection in us who, while piously abstaining from
eating our enemies, still persist in killing them.</p>

<p>The discontinuance of the practice of cannibalism—the
practice seems invariably to be left behind by all peoples as
soon as they have made any considerable advance in civilization<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>—may
with little hesitation be attributed in part at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
to the growth and refinement of the moral feelings. In one
case at least we have historical evidence that among a wide
reach of savage tribes the custom was abolished by the action
of a more civilized people, who did just what the more advanced
European nations, under the impulsion of moral
feeling, are doing in regard to the slave trade and cannibalism
in Africa to-day. The Incas of Peru, before granting to
conquered tribes terms of peace, forced them to abandon the
practice of cannibalism.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>The disuse of poisoned arrows marks another significant
mitigation of a common barbarity of early warfare. We know
that in the Greek world by the opening of the historic period
there were communities that had come to look on the use of
poisoned weapons with abhorrence, and to regard the practice
as a crime that aroused the anger of the gods. Thus Homer
represents Ilus of Ephyra, when asked by Odysseus for the
fatal poison wherewith to smear the tips of his arrows, as refusing
his request because he feared the immortal gods.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>In these mitigations and prohibitions of the barbarities of
war on the lower levels of savagery we have probably the
earliest articles of the war code of the nations. They mark
the first steps taken in the humanization of war. They indicate
the birth of those sympathetic and moral feelings which,
though of painfully slow growth and of intermittent action,
have during the course of the historic ages effected great
ameliorations of the cruelties of primitive warfare, and foreshadow
a time when war between civilized nations shall have
become an inconceivable thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reaction of intertribal upon intratribal morality</div>

<p>There is a heart of good in things evil. Even the habitual
intertribal wars of primitive communities contain a germ of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
good. The pressure exerted by these life-and-death struggles
upon the clan or tribe has a good effect upon the inner relationships
of the group. Many of the social virtues, such as
loyalty to comrades and self-devotion to the common weal,
are called into constant and keen activity. For this reason
we usually find these social virtues well developed among
peoples in the clan or tribal stage of civilization. Such peoples
may even be stronger in these special virtues than civilized
peoples.</p>

<p>But there is another side to this. Intertribal wars, though
they may in the very earliest stages of human culture be positively
promotive of some of the social virtues, in later and
more advanced stages exert a decidedly unfavorable influence
upon the moral development. The low backward standard
of intertribal ethics, reacting upon the higher and more
advanced intratribal standard, tends to make it like unto itself.
As Spencer expresses it, the life of internal amity
is assimilated to the life of external enmity. “Taken in the
mass the evidence shows,” he says, “as we might expect,
that in proportion as intertribal and international antagonisms
are great and constant, the ideas and feelings belonging
to the ethics of enmity predominate; and conflicting as
they do with the ideas and feelings belonging to the ethics of
amity proper to the internal life of a society, they in greater
or less degree suppress these, or fill with aggressions the
conduct of man to man.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Thus tribes engaged habitually
in war are characterized by the frequency of homicide
within the group. Tribes that regard the robbery of strangers
as honorable come to regard stealing within the tribe as
irreproachable.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Revengefulness, inhumanity, and untruthfulness
within each tribe characterize warlike communities.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> On
the other hand, peaceful tribes are characterized by their
superior intratribal morality. Tribes among whom war is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
infrequent or unknown are scrupulously honest.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Among
such people crimes of violence are rare.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>Thus war, a heritage (as a phase of the “struggle for existence”)
of the human from the lower animal world, becomes
early in the human stage of the cosmic evolution a drag upon
the moral progress of the race.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<span class="subhead">THE MORAL LIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT:
AN IDEAL OF SOCIAL JUSTICE</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_30a">I. <span class="smcap">Circumstances and Ideas which molded and
motived Morality</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">A homogeneous population and a comparatively static civilization</div>

<p>Egypt was the China of the ancient Mediterranean world.
Like the Chinese, the Egyptians were a comparatively unmixed
people. During the historic period no new elements
of importance were incorporated with the native population.
Again, like the civilization of China, that of Egypt throughout
a great part of the historic age was singularly static. After
having made wonderful advance in early times the Egyptians
ceased to make further noteworthy progress.</p>

<p>Both these fundamental facts of Egyptian history had great
significance for Egyptian morals; for since when races mingle
their blood they mingle also their moralities, it is a
matter of supreme importance to the moral life of a people
whether on the one hand it has, as the centuries have passed,
undergone a change in physical type through the incorporation
of new racial elements, or on the other hand has preserved
unchanged its racial type and physical characteristics.</p>

<p>Equally important for the moral ideal is it whether the civilization
of which it forms one element is progressive or unprogressive;
for changes in the moral standard are largely
dependent on changes in the other elements of civilization.
Where the intellectual life and the religious ideas remain
unmodified, and where all political, social, and industrial institutions
remain essentially unchanged, we need not look for
fundamental changes in ethical ideas and convictions. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
the history of conscience in ancient Egypt illustrates these
truths we shall see a little further on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The teaching that immortality is conditioned on righteousness</div>

<p>We have seen how potent an influence the notion of a life
beyond the tomb exercised upon the conduct of the members
of the primitive kinship group, giving birth to some of the
noblest virtues of their simple code of morals. Now this idea
of continued existence after death dominated the life of no
other civilized people of antiquity so completely as it dominated
the life of the Egyptians; and probably in the case of
no other people ancient or modern has the belief exerted so
profound an influence upon conduct. This was so for the
reason that the conception was here early moralized and represented
the blessed life in the hereafter as dependent upon
rightdoing in the present life. No soul that had done evil
was admitted to the bark of the ferryman at the Egyptian
Styx. In this discrimination we find “the earliest traces in
the history of man of an ethical test at the close of life.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethical qualities of the sun-god Ra</div>

<p>It is the sun-god Ra who in the remotest times is most intimately
associated with these moral requirements for participation
in the felicities of the celestial hereafter. The latest
reading and analysis of the texts of the Pyramid Age has
thrown new light upon the relations of the rival divinities Ra
and Osiris to the development of the moral consciousness in
ancient Egypt. In his latest work Professor Breasted says:
“The later rapid growth of ethical teaching in the Osiris faith
and the assumption of the rôle of judge by Osiris is not yet
discernible in the Pyramid Age, and the development which
made these elements so prominent in the Middle Kingdom took
place in the obscure period after the development of the Pyramid
Age. Contrary to the conclusions generally accepted at
present, it was the sun-god ... who was the earliest champion
of moral worthiness and the great judge in the hereafter.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>The conception of Ra as the righteous judge, as the father
and protector of the reigning Pharaoh, and as the guardian
divinity of the Egyptian state, influenced profoundly the moral
development in prefeudal Egypt, and was seemingly the inspiration
of the great social reform movement which marked
the history of the Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasties. In the
words of Professor Breasted, “The moral obligations emerging
in the Solar theology thus wrought the earliest social
regeneration and won the earliest battle for social justice of
which we know anything in history.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious dualism</div>

<p>In our introductory chapter we spoke of the influence of
physical environment upon the moral life of a people. The
history of the formation of the ethical type of ancient Egypt
affords an excellent illustration of this; for it was probably
out of the striking physical dualism of the Egyptian lands—the
antagonism between the life-giving Nile and the ever-encroaching
desert—that grew Egyptian religious dualism,
embodied in the myth of the struggle between Osiris and
Set.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> At first the tale was a pure nature myth reflecting
simply the conflict between two physical elements; but as the
moral consciousness of the people who recited the story deepened,
there was gradually read into it an ethical meaning.
The conflict was now conceived as a mighty struggle between
the powers of good and evil, between the beneficent Osiris
(and his son and avenger, Horus) and the malignant Set.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>This world philosophy reacted powerfully upon Egyptian
morality, keeping as it did in the foreground of the moral consciousness
the truth that the moral life is a battle against evil.
“The triumph of right over wrong ... is the burden of nine
tenths of the Egyptian texts which have come down to us.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Osirian myth in its special development</div>

<p>Acted upon by the moral feelings, the Osirian myth underwent
a special development. It came to represent not simply
the eternal opposition between good and evil, but the whole
moral order of the present and the future world. It told of
the beneficent life of Osiris as king of Egypt, his death and
resurrection, and of his office as king and judge in the realms
of the dead.</p>

<p>After having been given this rich moral content, the myth
reacted powerfully upon the moral consciousness and became
a chief agency in the formation of the moral character of the
Egyptian race. Osiris, as reflected in the Osirian myth, became
the incarnation of the ethical ideal. It is a great advantage
to morality when the ideal of goodness is thus embodied
in a divine exemplar. Osiris held some such relation to the
moral life of ancient Egypt as Christ holds to the moral life
of the Christian world.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_33">II. <span class="smcap">The Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">A homogeneous and unchanging conscience</div>

<p>By the dawn of history there had been developed in ancient
Egypt an enlightened and discriminating conscience.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
There are two aspects of this conscience which we need to
note. First, it was a comparatively homogeneous conscience;
that is, the morality of the ancient Egyptians was not a
mixture of moralities like that of the modern European
nations whose morality is a blend of the moralities of different
races—Greek, Roman, Celtic, and Teutonic; of
different religions—pagan and Christian; and of different
civilizations—Greek, Latin, Celtic, and German.</p>

<p>Second, it was a comparatively unchanging conscience.
The moral consciousness which we find in pre-Christian
Roman Egypt is fundamentally the same as that which
emerged in the Pyramid Age more than three thousand years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
before. During this long period the Egyptian conscience, although
it gained in depth and sensitiveness as the millenniums
passed, underwent less change in its essential qualities than the
moral consciousness underwent in less than ten centuries in
all the other great nations, save China, of the ancient world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidences of moral progress during early times</div>

<p>But though the moral development, like the development
of all other phases of Egyptian civilization, was early checked
and thereafter made but slow progress, the essential refinement
and clarification of the moral sense during prehistoric
times, or in the obscure period of the earliest dynasties, is
shown by various testimonies, as, for instance, in the moralization
of the Osirian myth, to which we have already referred,
in the abandonment of the practice of human sacrifices
at the tomb, and in the transition, concerning the conception
of the life after death, from the continuance to the
retribution theory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Substitution of ka-statues for human sacrifices</div>

<p>The early Egyptians, after the manner of savages, killed
and buried with the dead master a number of his slaves, that
their souls might attend him in the spirit land. But after a
time the growing humanitarian and ethical feelings of the
Egyptians forbade human sacrifices, and then merely the portrait-statues
of the slaves were placed in the tomb.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> These,
it was thought,—in consonance with the belief which led to
the substitution of pictures or of clay and wood models for
the real articles at first buried with the dead,—would take
the place of the actual bodies of the servants.</p>

<p>But as time passed, the deepening moral feelings of the
Egyptians would not permit them to do even this thing. It
did not now seem right to them that because a man was a
slave in the earthly Egypt he should be a slave forever in the
Osirian fields.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> So they ceased to place in the tomb of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
master these portrait-statues of his servants, and in their stead
put in statuettes of nobody in particular. The doubles of
these, it was conceived, would appear as newly created souls
in the underworld, and, being indebted for life itself to the
master of the tomb, would, it was naïvely assumed, gratefully
labor for him through all eternity.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>The history of the ka-statues, as these substitutes are called,
thus bears testimony similar to that of the Osirian myth as
to the upward trend of ethical thought and humanitarian
feeling in prehistoric Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Transition from the continuance to the retribution theory</div>

<p>Still further evidence of the advance on moral lines in
early Egypt is afforded by the character of the belief held by
the Egyptians at the beginning of the second millennium <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
and perhaps earlier respecting the fate of souls in the world
beyond the tomb. To understand this we need to cast our
glance a little aside and observe how the world of shades, in
its social and ethical classifications, has ever been a register
of the changing moral feelings of men. As Oscar Peschel
finely says, “The other world has ever answered to this as
spectrum to the source of light.”</p>

<p>Edward B. Tylor happily names the two chief theories
which have been held in regard to the state of souls in the
hereafter as the continuance and the retribution theory. The
first theory is that of primitive man while his moral sense is
yet undeveloped. According to this theory the same fate is
allotted to all who go down to death. There is no such thing
as rewards and punishments. This is the conception of the
after-life which is held by all races on the lower levels of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
culture, and it is a view which often lingers on as a survival
among peoples far advanced in civilization. But as the
moral judgment becomes more discriminating, then this view
of the other world is very certain to undergo a change. The
quickened sense of justice demands that the allotments after
death shall be in accordance with merit and demerit. This
ethical feeling gradually transforms the topography of the underworld
and organizes the as yet undivided community of
shades. The hitherto common abode of the dead is usually
divided into two distinct compartments or regions, heaven
and hell, and souls are separated, according to their deeds on
earth, into two classes, the good and the bad, those to be welcomed
to the abode of the blessed and these consigned to the
place of torment. Sometimes, however, the lot conceived for
the wicked is simply annihilation.</p>

<p>The incoming of this theory of rewards and punishments
after death constitutes a great landmark in the moral evolution
of mankind. In the words of Tylor, this transition from the
continuance to the retribution theory “for deep import to
human life has scarcely its rival in the history of religion.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
The sanctions of morality are doubled.</p>

<p>Now in ancient Egypt by the beginning of the second millennium
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the transition from the continuance to the retribution
theory had already been effected, as will appear in the following
account of the Egyptian Judgment of the Dead. Thus
here, as in the change of practices at the tomb, we have indisputable
evidence of the progress of moral ideas in early Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Judgment of the Dead</div>

<p>The Judgment of the Dead was the trial which every soul
had to undergo before Osiris and his forty-two assessors in the
great tribunal hall of the underworld. The astonishing thing
about this tribunal, as we have just intimated, is that at a time
when the oldest monuments raised in Egypt were yet recent
this whole conception of the moral order in all its details<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
was already fully matured.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Osiris had been raised to the
judgment seat in the other world, and the moral standard in
some departments of life, particularly in the relations of man
to man in the everyday social and business spheres, was as
high and true as is the standard in many of the civilized
nations of to-day. This admirable code of social morals points
unmistakably to long periods of organized society and moral
training in prefeudal Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Negative Confession</div>

<p>This early standard of goodness is embodied in the so-called
Negative Confession, in which the soul before the Osirian tribunal
pleaded his innocence of the forty-two sins condemned
by the Egyptian code of morality. This confession, previous
to the discovery of the Babylonian code of Hammurabi, constituted
the oldest known code of morality of the ancient
world. These are some of the declarations of the soul: “I
did not steal”; “I did not get any man treacherously
killed”; “I did not utter any lie”;<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> “I did not make any
one weep”; “I did not kill any sacred animals”; “I did
not damage any cultivated land”; “I was angry only when
there was reason [for being angry]”; “I did not turn a deaf
ear to the words of truth”; “I did not commit any act of
rebellion”; “I did not do any witchcraft”; “I did not
blaspheme a god”; “I did not make the slave to be misused
by his master”; “I was not imperious”; “I did not
strip the mummies of their stuff.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>After this confession to the forty-two assessors in the hall
of judgment, the soul made the following affirmative declaration,
which makes a singularly close approach to Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
morality: “I gave bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty,
garments to the naked, a bark to the one who was without
one [that is, a boat to the detained traveler], offerings to
the gods, and funeral conservations to the shades.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>After this confession and declaration the heart of the man
was placed in one scale of a balance and the image of Truth
in the other. If the heart was not found wanting, but
weighed just equal to the image, Osiris pronounced the soul
justified, and it was welcomed to the company of the blessed.
The punishment meted out to the soul found lacking seems
to have been of a negative nature—a denial of immortality.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparison of the morality of the Negative Confession with that of the Hebrew Decalogue and other codes</div>

<p>It is instructive to compare this ancient code, both in its
contents and in its omissions, with the moral codes of other
peoples and other ages. The similarity of the morality of
the Negative Confession to that of the Hebrew Decalogue
forces itself at once upon the attention.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> The Egyptian code,
however, lays less emphasis than the Hebrew upon religious
duties. In the forty-two duties named only seven are duties
toward the gods, while of the Ten Commandments five concern
religious duties. As we have already observed, the duties
of the Egyptian code are those due from man to man; that is,
they are social as opposed to religious duties.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to the Confucian code of the Chinese,
the Egyptian code gives very little place to the duties of children
to their parents. These duties are noticed, it is true,
by the Egyptian moralists, but no emphasis is laid upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
them. They are mentioned only once in the Negative Confession
before Osiris. As the stress laid by Chinese moralists
upon filial piety came about largely through the supposed
need of the spirits of the dead for regular offerings at the
grave, so it may be that the neglect of this virtue by the
Egyptian teachers is to be explained, as Flinders Petrie suggests,
by the circumstance that “the provision of offerings in
semblance by the Egyptians in the tomb left little place for
the urgency of filial duties in maintaining continual supplies
for the deceased.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>Another defect of Egyptian morality is its lack of depth
and seriousness. There is no hungering and thirsting after
righteousness, no passionate yearning for holiness. There is
no call to lofty self-sacrifice. It is a calm, prudent, worldly-wise,
practical morality. Its spirit and temper are well set
forth by Petrie when, in speaking of its virtues and vices, he
says that “these belong far more to the tone of Chesterfield
and Gibbon than to that of Kingsley and Carlyle.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>But in spite of the limitations and defects of the code, it
was one of the purest and loftiest framed by the moral consciousness
of the races of antiquity. The Negative Confession
shows that Egypt had early learned the lesson that blessedness
in the hereafter is conditioned on the practice of justice, truth,
and righteousness in the present life on earth.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral precepts of Ptah-hotep; an ethical conception of kinship</div>

<p>After the Negative Confession the most valuable memorial
of the character of the Egyptian conscience is found in the
precepts of the moralist Ptah-hotep,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> who lived probably in
the time of the Twelfth Dynasty. This moralist laid particular
emphasis upon the duties of rulers and of the rich and great.
His maxims are intended as a sort of “Manual of the Perfect
Official.” “If, having been of no account, thou hast
become great, and if, having been poor, thou hast become
rich, and if thou hast become governor of the city, be not
hard-hearted on account of thy advancement, because thou
hast become merely the guardian of the things which God
has provided.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> In like words emphasis is laid upon the
duties of gentleness and considerateness on the part of the
administrator and the judge. In truth the doctrine of trusteeship
of wealth and of office has never been more zealously
taught than in these precepts of the early Egyptian moralist.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>The teachings of Ptah-hotep respecting the duties of rulers
would seem to have made effective appeal to the heart and
conscience of even the holders of the royal office. In any
event we find these lofty conceptions of the duties of kingship
incarnated in the lives and deeds of several of the Pharaohs
of the Old Kingdom. The view held by these monarchs respecting
the nature of the royal office was almost exactly like
that entertained by the so-called benevolent despots of the
eighteenth century of our era. The inscriptions on the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
tomb boast not alone of exploits and triumphs in war, but the
prince vaunts himself for having put no ward in mourning,
for having made no distinction between the great and the
humble, for having been the protector of the widow and the
asylum of the orphan, and for having laid no unjust taxes.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Slavery approved by the Egyptian conscience</div>

<p>The Egyptian conscience, like the conscience of the ancient
world in general, did not condemn the institution of slavery.
The relation of master and slave was looked upon by the
Egyptians as perfectly natural and legitimate.</p>

<p>The slave class, which included both whites and blacks,
was recruited not only from the prisoners of war brought back
by the Pharaohs from their numerous foreign conquests, but
also from captives secured on regular man-hunting expeditions
into the negro regions of the Upper Nile.</p>

<p>The treatment of the slave was usually mild, and the development
of the moral feelings had already in early times
placed him under the protection of the gods. Thus in the
judgment hall of Osiris the soul repudiates the sin of oppression
by affirming, “I did not cause the slave to be misused
by his master.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>Respecting the moral side, in general, of the slave system
of antiquity, which we encounter now for the first time here
among the Egyptians, the following observation may be made.
If we except the Hebrews, we shall not find among the peoples
of the ancient world whose ethical standards we shall
pass in review any fundamental change throughout their
history in the common conscience regarding the rightfulness
of slavery. Indeed any radical and permanent change in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
moral feelings of men on this subject was hardly possible
till after the incoming of Christianity with its teachings of a
common Father-God and the brotherhood of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethics of war</div>

<p>One of the most striking phenomena of the moral evolution
of mankind is the unequal rate of movement on different
lines. Thus while morality has made great progress in
some departments of life, in the domain of war it has remained
comparatively stationary from the dawn of history
down almost to the present day. The war code of the modern
nations, notwithstanding improvements and ameliorations
to which our attention will be drawn later in our study, is
still in large part an unchanged heritage from the ages of
primitive savagery.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, it will not be a matter of surprise
to us that the laws of war of the Egyptians showed little advance
the practices of the negro savages of Africa; indeed
it seems probable that this part of the moral code of
Egypt was actually of African origin.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> There is not a word
in Egyptian literature in reprobation of war.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>While in their relations to their own people the Pharaohs
observed a comparatively enlightened code of ethics, being
in general humane, considerate, and clement, still in their
treatment of the vanquished they seem to have been wholly
insensible to all humanitarian feelings. Like the Assyrian
kings they “immortalized their cruelty in their art.” Numerous
scenes upon the monuments celebrate the Pharaoh’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
inhumanity; not one celebrates his compassion or mercy. He
is constantly represented in the act of slaying in heaps with
his own hands his bound and suppliant captives.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the moral ideal upon Egyptian life and history</div>

<p>Taken altogether, the moral standard of ancient Egypt, as
disclosed in the foregoing brief account of what the Egyptian
conscience condemned and what it approved, was not a high
one, but it was, in so far as it concerned the everyday life
of the people, wholly practical, and probably was as well lived
up to by the masses as our higher ideal of character is lived
up to by ourselves. We have a right to infer this from the
persistence of Egyptian institutions through two thirds of the
historic millenniums; for no nation or society can long endure
where the relations of man to man and of subject to
ruler are not in substantial agreement with the real convictions
of the age as to what constitutes essential justice and
righteousness.</p>

<p>The moral standard of the Egyptians has been compared
to that of the Romans after it had felt the influence of Stoicism
and Christianity. Like the Roman ideal of excellence
at its best, the Egyptian ideal tended to develop a strong and
manly type of character, particularly in the ruling class. We
think it not an illusion which causes us to see the influence
of the ideal in the face of Rameses the Great. This face bears
the stamp of strength, resolution, indomitable energy. We
may believe that it was the moral ideal which had something
to do in creating such a type of character as we see here, just
as it was the primitive Roman ideal which helped to create
that admirable type of character which lives in the legends
of early Rome.</p>

<p>Further, the moral ideal tended to ameliorate the autocratic
government of the Pharaohs by holding constantly before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
ruler the example of the righteous and beneficent king-gods
Ra and Osiris. The influence of the ideal in this relation may
be likened to the influence of the moral ideal of Christianity
upon the government of the later Cæsars.</p>

<p>Again, the practical moral ideal of Egypt, laying its emphasis
upon the fundamental social virtues, helped to establish
and maintain relations of justice and equity between man
and man, and thus contributed to the general well-being of
Egyptian society and to the stability of Egyptian institutions.</p>

<p>Nor was the influence of the moral ideal of Egypt confined
to the Egyptian land. For, as Amélineau truly says, the
wonderful edifice of morality is the collective work of all
peoples and all ages.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> In the uprearing of this edifice Egypt
played a great rôle. Her contributions to the morality of the
first nations were as helpful, we may believe, as were those
she made to the other domains—material, artistic, and
intellectual—of the civilization of the early world.</p>

<p>Later she made a rich bequest to European morality, a bequest
only less important perhaps than that made by Judea.
Her ideas of the future life, her meditations on death and
the final judgment, reënforced the teachings of Christianity
and thus contributed to create that deep conviction of a life
hereafter and a coming retribution which for eighteen hundred
years and more has furnished sanction and stimulus
to the moral life of Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> It is not without significance
that Christian monasticism, with all its otherworldliness,
had its beginnings in Egypt. “The first Christian monk
[Pachomius] had been a pagan monk of Serapis.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<span class="subhead">THE BABYLONIAN-ASSYRIAN CONSCIENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The importance of Babylonian-Assyrian morality for the history of comparative morals</div>

<p>The information which the cuneiform texts have yielded
concerning the moral life of the Babylonian and Assyrian
peoples, though scanty, is of the greatest value to the student
of comparative morals, not only because it casts light upon
a moral development in some important respects like the
moral evolution of the kindred Semitic people of Israel, but
also because that later evolution was probably deeply influenced
by it. Therefore, though nothing like a connected account
of the moral evolution in the Euphratean lands can be
attempted till the thousands of cuneiform tablets recovered
from the ancient libraries of the Babylonian-Assyrian cities
have been deciphered, and the ethical character and value
of their contents determined, we shall devote a few pages to
the portrayal of such manifestations of conscience as are
disclosed in the religious, literary, historical, and law tablets
whose contents are already known to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The general nonethical character of the Babylonian-Assyrian religion</div>

<p>Religion filled a large place in the life of the ancient Babylonians
and Assyrians, especially in that of the former; but
religion with them had at first little or nothing to do with
morality. Like the religion of savage and barbarian folk, it
lacked wholly or almost wholly the ethical spirit. Throughout
the early period it was in the main simply a system of incantations
and magical rites. Scarcely any moral element
entered into the system until the later centuries of Babylonian-Assyrian
history.</p>

<p>This religion was in truth simply a survival from primitive
savage times when religion was merely a belief in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
existence of evil spirits, and in their disposition and power to
do harm to men.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> In this stage of the religious evolution sickness,
death, misadventure of every kind are believed to be
caused by some malignant demon or by some offended and
revengeful god. The evil spirits are supposed to act from pure
malignancy, while the great gods are conceived to be angered
especially by the nonobservance of some religious rite, by the
violation of some taboo forbidding the use of certain kinds of
food, or by some other like act.</p>

<p>To ward off the attacks of the evil demons, or to appease
the offended gods, recourse was had to the recital of magical
formulas and incantations. This was Shamanism in its lowest
and crudest form, in which there was at work as a motive on
the part of the suppliant only cringing fear or a desire to
get rid of some present pain, without the least trace of moral
emotions, such as remorse and repentance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethical tendencies in the religion</div>

<p>But as time passed, this earlier nonethical religion, as is
evidenced by the texts recovered from the long-buried temple
libraries,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> became in a measure moralized. A moral
character was given to the great gods, and they became the
inspirers and guardians of a true morality. This ethicalizing
process was the same in character as that which went on in
the religion of the ancient Hebrews, gradually moralizing the
primitive conceptions and cult of Yahweh until among that
people religion and morality became wholly at one. The
ethical development, however, never went as far as this in
Babylonia and Assyria, but the movement was such as to lift
these peoples far above the low moral plane of primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
society. “In the seventh century before Christ, if not earlier,
the Babylonians and Assyrians possessed a system of morality
which in many respects resembled that of the descendants
of Abraham.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence afforded by the penitential psalms of the growth in moral feeling</div>

<p>The ethical movement found its truest expression in the
so-called penitential hymns,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> which are in spirit altogether
like the penitential psalms of the Hebrew Scriptures.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> They
exhibit the same intense yearning of the penitent soul for
reconciliation and union with a god conceived as just and
holy and piteous.</p>

<p>In one hymn is found the new moral conception that disease
is the work of a good spirit. This is a very lofty ethical
idea, and approaches the Hebrew conception of afflictions as
the visitation in disguise of love. But this idea seems never
to have become a permanent part of the Babylonian moral
consciousness.</p>

<p>In these psalms and prayers we have evidence that at times
the worshipers of Marduk and Ashur attained to almost as
lofty a conception of deity as that reached by the teachers
and prophets of Israel. The great gods were conceived as
the creators, the sustainers of man; as loving, compassionate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
merciful, and forgiving. The religious-moral ideal was here
verging toward the highest that man has ever been able to
form, and could this standard have been steadily upheld and
the lower abandoned, then Babylonia and Assyria like Judea
might have made precious contributions to the moral life of
humanity. But this was not done. The tablets holding magical
formulas and incantations, wholly devoid of all ethical
character, outnumber a thousand to one those exhaling the
spiritual perfume of genuine moral feeling and aspiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethical significance of the conception of the after life</div>

<p>Respecting the lot of the dead, the Babylonians held views
like those of the early Hebrews. This was the continuance
as opposed to the retribution theory.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> Arallu, “the land of
no return,” was a vast underground region where were gathered
all, without distinction, who went down to the grave. It
was a sad, dolorous life that the drowsing shades lived in
this dark underworld, where the bats flitted in the twilight
and the dust gathered on the lintels of the doors. An undiscriminating
fate allotted the same destiny to all. In so far
as the moral consciousness of the Babylonians demanded that
a distinction be made between the good and the bad, this
demand was met by the assumption—which was also that
of the Hebrews so long as they held the Babylonian view of
the life after death—that the evil man is punished in this
life, and the good man rewarded here on earth with numerous
flocks, reputation, many children, and long life.</p>

<p>For four thousand years the masses in Babylonia seem to
have remained satisfied with this view of the moral government
of the world. In the later periods of Babylonian history,
however, we find in the literature traces of a protest against
this nonethical conception of life in the afterworld—a protest
which shows that, in the case of the more spiritually minded
at least, the moral consciousness was deepening and the
ethical judgment becoming clearer and truer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethical spirit of the laws; the code of Hammurabi</div>

<p>Since the law code of a people embraces all those duties
the performance of which the state or public authority attempts
to enforce, the ethical spirit of an age or people finds one of
its truest embodiments in its laws. It is this fact which renders
of such extraordinary interest to the student of the history
of morals the recent discovery of the code of the Babylonian
king Hammurabi,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> the oldest known code of public and private
morality. This law system exhibits in some departments of
life an enlightened and advanced morality, yet one with serious
limitations and defects, a morality in many respects like that
of the Mosaic code of the kindred Semitic nation of Israel.</p>

<p>The code informs us that the Babylonian feeling as to
what is right and wrong, just and unjust, in the ordinary
business relations of life was much like the average conscience
of to-day. In some matters the Babylonian law held
ground morally in advance of that held by modern codes, as,
for instance, in providing that in case of misfortune the
debtor should have both his rent and the interest on his
debt remitted.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>But in its provisions touching the family relations the code
reveals ethical conceptions very different from our own. As
in other Oriental law systems, ancient and modern, polygamy
was regarded as a moral institution. A man in debt could
bind his wife and children out to service or sell them as
slaves, but not for a longer period than three years.</p>

<p>The punishments meted out to offenders were harsh and
cruel, yet not much more atrociously cruel than those provided
by the English laws of three hundred years ago. Impaling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
burning, cutting out the tongue, gouging out the eyes, cutting
off the fingers, breaking the bones of the hands were common
penalties.</p>

<p>Sometimes the punishment was measured by the primitive
principle of the <i>Lex talionis</i>; it was eye for eye, bone for
bone, tooth for tooth.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> This law of retaliation was carried out
so rigorously as to result in the punishment of the innocent
for the guilty. Thus if a man caused the death of another
man’s daughter, the law required that his own daughter
should be put to death.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> If a builder, through the faulty
construction of a house, caused the death of the son of the
owner through the falling of the house, the son of the builder
was to be put to death.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> It is in these provisions of the code
that we find the greatest divergence between the Babylonian
feeling and our own as to what is right and just. Yet this
Babylonian conscience which sanctioned the visiting of the
iniquity of the father upon the children is a conscience which
we shall meet with in societies much more advanced than
that for which the Hammurabi code was formulated.</p>

<p>The Babylonian conscience in regard to slavery as embodied
in the code was about like our own conscience respecting
negro slavery of a generation or two ago. The slave was
viewed as a mere chattel, and the master possessed over him
the power of life and death. Kind treatment, however, was
enjoined by the law. There was a fugitive-slave law which
reads curiously like our negro-slave laws of two generations
ago, in which the aiding and harboring of a fugitive slave is
made a crime punishable with death.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>The slave class was recruited, as in other lands of the
ancient world, from prisoners of war, foundlings, debtors,
criminals, and through the sale by fathers and husbands of
their children and wives. The system seems to have undergone
no essential changes or ameliorations, such as we shall
see effected in the Hebrew system, by growth in ethical feeling
during the four thousand years of Babylonian history. It
is true that enfranchisement of slaves was not uncommon,
the freed man becoming the dependent of his old master,
but it does not appear that moral sentiment afforded the
motive for manumission.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">International morality; war ethics</div>

<p>The international ethics of the Babylonians and Assyrians
was in every essential respect the international ethics of their
age in the Semitic world. It was the character of the religion
of these peoples which determined in large measure international
relations in the Mesopotamian lands throughout the
period of Semitic ascendancy. “The conception of religion as
an alliance between God and man against other peoples and
their gods never ceased in Mesopotamia.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> This conception
was essentially the same as that held by the Hebrews down
to the time of the great prophets. “Let us go up against
them, for our god is greater than their god,” is the war cry
of four thousand years of history of the Semitic world.</p>

<p>The Assyrians far surpassed the Babylonians in their ferocious
cruelty in the treatment of war captives. Notwithstanding
their advanced morality in some departments of life, in
this domain they stood, if we except the practice of cannibalism,
on practically the same level as savages. Witness the
following inscription of Assur-natsir-pal, in which he tells of
his treatment of certain prisoners of war: “The nobles, as
many as had revolted, I flayed; with their skins I covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
the pyramid. Some [of these] I immured in the midst of the
pyramid; others above the pyramid I impaled on stakes....
Three thousand of their captives I burned with fire. I left
not one alive among them to become a hostage.... I cut
off the hands [and] feet of some; I cut off the noses, the ears
[and] the fingers of others; the eyes of the numerous soldiers
I put out. In the middle [of them] I suspended their heads
on vine stems in the neighborhood of their city. Their young
men [and] their maidens I burned as a holocaust.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>The significant thing here is not so much the fact that
these things were done, as the fact that the king exults in
having done them and thinks to immortalize himself by
portraying them upon imperishable stone. The careful way
in which to-day all reference to atrocities of this character,
when in the fury of battle they are inflicted upon a savage
enemy, are suppressed by those responsible for them, and the
indignant condemnation of them by the public opinion of the
civilized world, measures the moral progress humanity has
made even along those lines on which progress has been so
painfully slow and halting.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<span class="subhead">CHINESE MORALS: AN IDEAL OF FILIAL PIETY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_53a">I. <span class="smcap">Ideas, Institutions, and Historical Circumstances
determining the Cast of the Moral Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Introductory</div>

<p>With the exception of the teachers of the ancient Hebrews,
the leaders of thought of no people have so insistently interpreted
life and history in terms of ethics as have the sages
of the Chinese race. And, excepting the Hebrew teachers, no
moralists have so emphasized duties while leaving rights—upon
which the Western world in modern times has laid
such stress—to take care of themselves.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>It cannot fail to enhance our interest in a study of the ideal
upheld by these teachers of morality, if we recall that this
ideal of character has for upwards of three thousand years exercised
an incalculable influence upon the moral life of probably
a fourth of the human race and is the cement of a social
structure that has outlasted all others of the ancient world.</p>

<p>The cast of this moral ideal affords a good illustration of the
way in which the moral type of a people is molded by religious
and philosophical ideas, social institutions, race experiences,
and physical environment. Following our usual method of exposition
we shall begin our examination of Chinese morality by
first casting a glance at some of the agencies which have been
especially influential in the creation of the ethical standard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confucianism: the state worship of Heaven and the popular worship of ancestors</div>

<p>There are two religious elements in Confucianism which have
special significance for Chinese morality. These are, first, the
state worship of Heaven and of the lesser gods of the sky and
earth; and second, the popular cult of ancestral spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>The worship of Heaven, the supreme deity, is a state
function; that is, it is a matter which is left entirely to the
Emperor and the magistrates. Consequently those duties to
God, that is, to a being looked upon as Creator and Father,—duties
of reverence, love, and worship, which fill so large
a place in the moral ideals of Judaism and Christianity,—find
scarcely any place among the duties enjoined upon the
multitude by Confucianism.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>The worship of ancestors is the essential and popular element
of Confucianism. Commenting on the ethical value of
this cult, Dr. Martin affirms that “in respect to moral efficiency,
it would appear to be only second to that of faith in
the presence of an all-seeing Deity.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> The constant and reverent
dwelling upon the virtues of their ancestors has exalted
the virtue of filial piety among the Chinese to the highest
place in their ideal of character and has helped to make respect
for what is old, for what has been handed down from
ancestral ages, a highly prized virtue and a distinguishing
trait of the race character.</p>

<p>In an indirect way also ancestor worship has exerted a
great influence upon the moral life of the Chinese people,
for this worship is necessarily a family cult and must be
cared for by the head of the family. This has prevented the
growth of a priestly caste in Confucian China. The absence
of a powerful national priesthood has been a great boon to
Chinese morality. The place thus left vacant has been filled
by the <i lang="la">literati</i>, or learned class,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> whose influence upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
ethical life of the people has, without question, been more
beneficent than that of a priestly class would have been.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Demonism: evil spirits the ministers of retributive justice</div>

<p>Besides peopling the invisible world with beneficent ancestral
spirits, the Chinese have filled heaven and earth with
innumerable demons or evil spirits. Even the souls of dead
men, if they have been wronged on earth or if their wants
since death have been undutifully neglected, may become
malignant, revengeful spirits. These demons are believed to
be the cause of all kinds of diseases, of blight and famine,
and of every misfortune befalling men.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>The thing about this Chinese demonism which is of interest
to the student of morals is that, unlike the demonism of
Babylonia (p. 46), or that of the Middle Ages in Europe, it
contains a distinct ethical element. There was little or nothing
ethical in the Babylonian or the medieval belief in the
existence of evil spirits because the good man and the bad
were indifferently the victims of their malignant activity. But
the Chinese have moralized their demonism and conceive
these spirits as under the control of Heaven and without
power to do harm without Heaven’s commission or consent.
They thus represent retributive justice and become the ministers
of the Supreme Power to punish evildoers, like Nemesis
and the Erinyes of the Greeks. It is this ethical side
of the Chinese belief in evil spirits which causes De Groot,
in emphasizing the import of this demonism for Chinese
morality, to say that “it occupies the rank of moral educator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
of the people, and has fulfilled a great mission to many thousands
of millions who have lived and died on Asiatic soil.
Demonism, the lowest form of religion, in China a source of
ethics and moral education—this certainly may be called a
singular phenomenon, perhaps the only one of its kind to be
found on this terrestrial globe.” <a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Taoism: nature the exemplar</div>

<p>Next to Confucianism and demonism, Taoism has been
the most important moral force in the life of the Chinese
people. Taoism was originally a lofty philosophical ethical
system out of which was developed later a religion.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> The
philosophy, however, has always remained something quite
distinct from the religious system.</p>

<p>The essence of Taoism is the pantheistic doctrine that the
universe, or nature, is God. The ethical character of the universe
is revealed in its way or method, which is <i>Tao</i>. Now
the characteristics of nature as disclosed in its method of
operation are constancy—“heaven never diverges from its
course”; unselfishness—“the earth nourishes all things”;
impartiality—“the earth brings forth its fruits for all alike”;
placidity—“heaven is calm, serene, passionless”; humility—the
sun which “after shining sets,” the moon which “after
fullness, wanes,” the warmth of summer which “when it
has finished its work retires,” water which “seeks the lowest
place,” all these are symbols of “nature’s humility.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>What gives these interpretations of the ethical qualities
of nature their importance for human morality is that man’s
highest duty is to imitate the universe, to behave as nature
behaves.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> “Taoism is the exhibition of a way or method of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
living which men should cultivate as the brightest and purest
development of their nature.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> “The true Taoist then is
the man who unites in himself [the] virtues or qualities of the
universe, including the constant virtues.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> Man’s way must
be nature’s way (Tao). The perfect man must cultivate constancy,
unselfishness, impartiality, benevolence, impassibility,
serenity, humility, and quietness, for these are the characteristics
of the universe.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>This Taoist code is designed especially for rulers.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> He
who has assimilated all his virtues to the virtues of nature is
qualified to administer government.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> It is in the qualities of
character cultivated by the highest-minded ministers and mandarins,
and in the state worship and official customs that we
are to look for the main ethical influence of the doctrines
of Taoism.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The conception of human nature as good</div>

<p>“The tendency of man’s nature to good,” says Mencius,
“is like the tendency of water to flow downwards.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Just as
the theological dogma that man’s nature is hereditarily corrupt,
with a proneness to evil, has shaped and colored a large
part of Christian ethics, so has this opposing conception of
human nature as good exercised a tremendous influence upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the ethical ideal of the Chinese race.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> For if man’s nature
is good, then for him to live conformably to his nature is to
live rationally, that is, morally. “To nourish one’s nature,”
declared Mencius, “is the way to secure heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>Objections to this view of human nature, based on the fact
that men are actually very different in moral character, are
met by saying that this difference is the effect of environment,
just as the inequalities in the yield of barley seed are
due not to a difference in the nature of the grain but to the
different qualities of the soil.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> In a word, it is the social environment—instruction
and example—which determines the
character of men. “By nature,” says Confucius, “men are
nearly alike; by practice they get to be far apart.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>As we shall see, it makes a vast difference in a man’s conception
as to what he ought to do,—as to how he should regulate
his life,—whether he believes his nature to be inclined
to virtue and all his instincts, impulses, and appetites to be
good, or believes his nature to be corrupt and all his instincts
and appetencies to be evil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conception of the past as perfect</div>

<p>Another conception that has had a molding influence upon
the moral ideal of China is the conception of the past as perfect
without any historic lapse from this perfection. To understand
the import of this in the ethical history of China we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
must compare it with the theological conception of the fall
of man. This conception determined what should be the saving
virtues of the historic ethical ideal of the Western world,
making them to be theological in character and having to
do with man’s restoration from an hereditary fallen state.</p>

<p>Now the Chinese, instead of believing in the lapse of man
from a state of original innocence, conceive the past as perfect.
This interpretation of history has had the effect of making
reverence for the past, for the customs, institutions, and
teachings of the fathers, a chief virtue of the moral ideal.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
The far-reaching consequences for Chinese life and history
which the emphasis laid upon this virtue has had will be the
subject of remark a little further on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Geographical and intellectual isolation</div>

<p>Again, the moral development of the Chinese people has
been profoundly influenced by the geographical isolation of
China. From the earliest times down almost to the present
day China was shut out from intercourse with the civilized
and progressive nations of the West, and was surrounded by
neighbors greatly her inferior in intellectual, social, and moral
culture. The effect of this isolation upon the Chinese was
to foster in them an exaggerated self-esteem and a feeling of
contempt for foreigners. In this respect the masses are still
ethically in that stage of development that the Greeks were
in when they looked contemptuously upon all non-Greeks as
“barbarians.”</p>

<p>In still another way has the physical and intellectual isolation
of the Chinese people reacted upon their ethical life.
This isolation has prevented progress beyond a certain stage,
and where there is no progress or very slow progress there
is likely to grow up an undue attachment to ways and customs
that are old. This is what has happened in China, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
has worked together with the worship of ancestors to create
one of the main requirements of the ideal of character, namely,
reverence for the past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The appearance of great men: Confucius and Mencius</div>

<p>Besides the various agencies already passed under review,
the teachings of two great moralists, Confucius and Mencius,
have been a vital force in the shaping of the moral ideal of
China. The greater of these sages was Confucius (551–478
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) He was unimaginative and practical. He was not
an original thinker. His mission was not to found a new religion
or hold up a new ideal of character, but to give new
force and effectiveness to the already existing moral code of
his time and people.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> His teachings were especially effective
in giving filial piety the fixed place it holds in the moral ideal
of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The influence of Mencius (371–288 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), whose teachings
are characterized by an emphatic denunciation of the wickedness
of war, is to be traced particularly in the low place which
is assigned in the Chinese standard of character to the martial
virtues, and the general disesteem in which the military
life is held.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_60">II. <span class="smcap">The Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The four cardinal virtues</div>

<p>Chiefly under the molding influence of the agencies noticed
in the preceding sections, there was shaped in early
times in China one of the most remarkable moral ideals of
history, an ideal which has been a guiding and controlling
force in the moral life of probably more of the human race
than any other of the ethical ideals of mankind.</p>

<p>The duties given the highest place in this standard of
character are filial obedience, reverence for superiors, a conforming
to ancient custom, and the maintenance of the just
medium. The man who is carefully observant of these duties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
is looked upon in China as a man of superior excellence. In
the following pages we shall speak with some detail of each
of these requirements of the ethical ideal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Filial obedience or piety</div>

<p>In an analysis of the symbols used in the Chinese system
of writing Dr. Legge points out the significant fact that one
of the oldest of these characters, the one standing for filial
piety, was originally the picture of a youth upholding on his
shoulders an old man.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> In this worn-down symbol is embodied
the fundamental fact in the moral life of the Chinese people.
It tells us that the first of family virtues, filial piety, the virtue
that formed the basis of the strength and greatness of early
Rome, constituted also the firm foundation upon which the
enduring fabric of Chinese society was raised. The whole
framework of the social structure is modeled on the family,
and all relations and duties are assimilated, in so far as
possible, to those of the domestic circle.</p>

<p>In no other of the moral ideals of history do we find a
more prominent place given the duties of children toward
their parents. It was ancestor worship, doubtless, as we have
already said, which gave these duties this foremost place in
the moral code, and which through all the millenniums of
Chinese history has maintained for them the highest place
in the Chinese standard of moral excellence.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> The Classic
of Filial Piety declares: “The services of love and reverence
to parents when alive, and those of grief and sorrow to them
when dead—these completely discharge the fundamental duty
of living men.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> “The Master said: ‘There are three thousand
offenses against which the five punishments are directed,
and there is not one of them greater than being unfilial.’”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>The punishments which the Chinese laws enjoin for unfilial
conduct bear witness to the high estimation in which
the Chinese moralists and rulers hold the virtue of filial
obedience and reverence. Thus a parent may, with the consent
of the maternal uncle, require a magistrate to whip to
death an unfilial son.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> A parricide is beheaded, his body cut
in pieces, his house torn down, his neighbors are punished,
his chief teacher is put to death, and the magistrates of the
district in which he lived are degraded or deposed.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reverence toward superiors</div>

<p>Filial piety is regarded by Chinese moralists as the root
out of which grow all other virtues. Immediately out of this
root springs the duty of obedience and reverence toward all
superiors. This is the corner stone of the Chinese system of
political ethics. “In the family life,” in the words of Jernigan,
“may be seen the larger life of the empire.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A conforming to ancient custom</div>

<p>We have here the third of the cardinal duties, the duty
which in practice constitutes the heart and core of Chinese
morality.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> The commandment is, Follow the ancients; walk
in the trodden paths; let to-day be like yesterday. This duty,
as we have already noticed, springs from the Chinese conception
of the past as perfect. If that past be perfect, then
of course it becomes the duty of living men to make the present
like unto it, and in no case to depart from the customs
and practices of the fathers.</p>

<p>We can easily make the Chinese view in this matter intelligible
to ourselves by recalling how we have been wont to
regard the religious past of that Hebrew world of which we
are the heirs. Sanctity in our minds has attached to it all,
and we regard any departure from the teachings and commandments
of that past to be a fault, even a species of
wickedness deserving eternal punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>Now in China this idea of sanctity, which among ourselves
attaches only to the religious side of life, has attached to all
phases of life, to government, to society, to art, to science,
to trade and commerce—to all of the ideas, ways, and customs
of antiquity. As their fathers did, so must the children
do. They must deem worthy what their fathers deemed worthy
and love what their fathers loved.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> He who departs from the
beliefs and practices of the ancients is regarded as irreverent
and immoral, just as he who with us departs from the
beliefs and customs of the fathers in religion is looked upon
as presumptuous and irreligious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The maintenance of the just medium</div>

<p>The virtue with which we here have to do is akin to the
Greek virtue of moderation. It consists in never going to
extremes, in avoiding excess in everything, in being always
well balanced, standing in the middle, and leaning not to
either side; “to go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>
One of the sacred books of the Chinese, called <i>Chung Yung</i>,
which is ascribed to a grandson of Confucius, and in which is
portrayed an ideally perfect character, The Princely Man,
celebrates this virtue of the just medium.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> This portraiture
of the perfect man, held up as a pattern for imitation to the
successive generations of Chinese youth, has been a molding
force in the moral life of the Chinese race.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The duty of intellectual self-culture</div>

<p>Having now spoken of the four cardinal virtues of the Chinese
standard of excellence, we shall next proceed to speak
more briefly of several other virtues, which, though not given
the most prominent place in the ideal, are nevertheless
assigned a high place among the virtues exemplified by the
perfect man.</p>

<p>First among these we note that of intellectual self-culture.
Concerning this virtue and duty the Chinese sages have
thoughts like those of the Greek teachers. Confucius taught
that true morality is practically dependent upon learning. “It
is not easy,” he says, “to find a man who has learned for three
years without coming to be good.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> Here we have, as in the
teachings of the Greek philosophers, knowledge made almost
identical with goodness. Intellectual culture and good morals
run together. Again the Master, speaking of the ancients, says:
“Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere;
their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>
“How would it be possible,” asks Lao-tsze, “to go forward in
one’s knowledge and go backward in one’s morals?”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>This commendation of learning by the sages, as we shall
see further on, gave a great impulse to the educational system
of China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duties of rulers</div>

<p>The teachings of Chinese moralists are especially marked
by the emphasis laid upon the duties of rulers. In the times
of Confucius there was lack of union between the different
provinces, and China was in a state bordering on political
anarchy. A chief aim of the teachings of the Master was to
correct this condition of things by laying stress upon the
duties of those in authority. Never have the duties of rulers
been more insistently inculcated.</p>

<p>In the first place Confucius set a high aim for the state,
an aim altogether like that set by Plato for the ideal Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
city. He makes the end of government to be virtue and
not wealth. Its aim should be to promote goodness and not
merely material prosperity: “In a state, pecuniary gain is
not to be considered to be prosperity, but prosperity will be
found in righteousness.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>The indispensable qualification in the ruler is goodness.
“The love of what is good,” declares Mencius, “is more
than a sufficient qualification for the government of the empire.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
The ruler should be a father to his people, kind and
benevolent, should instruct them, should follow the laws of
the ancient kings, should be a model for his subjects, should
leave a good example to future ages.</p>

<p>Much is said by the Master respecting the influence of
the example set by the ruler: “When the ruler as a father,
a son, a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
The relation between superior and inferior is like that between
the wind and the grass: “The grass must bend when
the wind blows across it.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> “Never has there been a case of
the sovereign loving benevolence and the people not loving
righteousness.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> “If good men were to govern a country in
succession for a hundred years, they would be able to transform
the violently bad and dispense with capital punishment.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>But there has never been such a succession of good rulers
in China. Respecting the influences and circumstances which
have brought about a great discrepancy between the ideal and
practice we shall have something to say in the last division
of this chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disesteem of the heroic or martial virtues</div>

<p>The Chinese ideal of goodness and nobility allows no place
among its virtues to the qualities of the warrior, which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
in general been given such a prominent place in the moral
ideals of almost all other peoples throughout all periods of
history. Soldiers hold a very low place in the social scale; they
are looked upon as a “pariah class,” and their life is regarded
as degrading. The Emperor of China, “alone among
the great secular rulers of the world, never wears a sword.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>This spirit of opposition to militarism is embodied in the
teachings of the great moralist Mencius. “The warlike
Western world has scarcely known a more vigorous and sweeping
protest against warfare and everything connected with
it and every principle upon which it is based.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> To gain
territory by the slaughter of men Mencius declared to be
contrary to the principles of benevolence and righteousness.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>
He speaks as follows of the military profession: “There are
men who say, I am skillful at marshaling troops. I am skillful
in conducting a battle. They are great criminals.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> In
<i>Spring and Autumn</i>, a chronicle of early Chinese history,
he declares, “There are no righteous wars,” though he
admits that one might be better than another.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>Confucius also, though he did not lay the stress upon the
inherent wickedness of war that was placed upon it by
Mencius, maintained that the same rules of morality apply
in the relations of nations as in those of individuals, and
taught that differences between nations should be settled by
arbitration and by considerations of equity and justice, not
by brute force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Principles and inner disposition</div>

<p>It is often affirmed that the teachings of Chinese moralists
are defective in that they consist in moral precepts rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
than in moral principles, that they lay stress upon the observance
of minute rules of conduct rather than upon the inner
disposition. There is, however, in the body of ethical teachings
of the sages no lack of insistence upon principles of
conduct and upon states and dispositions of mind and heart.
All must be right within the heart, says Confucius, for “what
truly is within will be manifested without.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> “Let the prince
be benevolent,” says Mencius, “and all his acts will be benevolent;
let the prince be righteous and all his acts will be
righteous.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> Have no depraved thoughts, sums up the contents
of the three hundred pieces in the Book of Poetry.
“In the ceremony of mourning,” says Confucius again, “it
is better that there be deep sorrow than a minute attention
to observances.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>And it is the same teaching as to what constitutes true
morality which we find in such sayings as these: “The doctrine
of our Master is to be true to the principles of our
nature.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> “Man is born for uprightness,”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> and he should
love virtue as he loves beauty,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> for its own sake.</p>

<p>In reciprocity Confucius found that same comprehensive
rule of conduct which is rightly regarded as one of the noblest
principles of Christian morality. Being asked if there was one
word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one’s life, the
Master said: “Is not reciprocity such a word? What you do
not want done to yourself, do not do to others.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>And surely nothing could be farther from mere preceptorial
teaching than these words of Mencius: “Let a man not do
what his own sense of righteousness tells him not to do;...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
To act thus is all he has to do.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> And in the following
utterances the sages of China speak with an accent strangely
like that of the Great Prophet of Israel: “The great man is
he who does not lose his child heart.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Again, “I like life; I
also like righteousness. If I cannot keep the two together, I
will let life go and choose righteousness.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Still again: “With
coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for
a pillow—I have still joy in the midst of these things.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>In the following Mencius shows that he understood the
moral use of dark things: “When Heaven is about to confer
a great office on any man, it first exercises his mind with suffering
and his sinews and bones with toil. It exposes his
body to hunger and subjects him to extreme poverty. It confounds
his undertakings. By all these methods it stimulates
his mind, hardens his nature, and supplies his incompetencies.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>
And again: “Life springs from sorrow and calamity,
and death from ease and pleasure.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> “Men who are possessed
of intelligent virtue and prudence in affairs will generally be
found to have been in sickness and trouble.”<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Defects of the ideal: no duties to God, and the duties of parents to children not emphasized</div>

<p>Regarded from our point of view the Confucian ideal of
moral character has serious limitations and defects. First, it
omits practically all duties to God. In the words of Dr. Legge,
“man’s duty to God is left to take care of itself.” God or
Heaven was a subject of which Confucius seldom spoke, and
the Chinese have in this matter followed the example of the
Master. Heaven is not in all their thoughts.</p>

<p>If we recall what an influence the conception of a supreme
being as Creator and Father has exerted upon the morality
of all the races that have accepted as their creed the ethical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
monotheism of the Hebrew teachers, we shall realize how
fundamentally the Chinese ideal of excellence has been modified
by the omission of all those duties which have entered
into our own moral code as duties owed to God.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>Second, while laying such stress upon the duties of children
to their parents, Confucianism is almost silent regarding
the duty of parents to their children. At this point there is
a wide divergence between the Christian and the Chinese
conception of duty. Commenting upon this matter, Dr. Legge
says: “I never quoted in a circle of Chinese friends the
words of Paul in Corinthians—‘The children ought not to
lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children’—without
their encountering a storm of opposition. When I
tried to show that the sentiment was favorable to the progress
of society, and would enable each generation to start from a
higher standpoint, I found it difficult to obtain a hearing.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>The effects of the family ethics of Confucianism upon the
moral practice of the Chinese in the domestic sphere will be
noted in the following division of this chapter.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_69">III. <span class="smcap">Effects of the Ideal upon Chinese Life
and History</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Degree of accordance between theory and practice; mandarin morality</div>

<p>No people have ever lived up to their ideal of moral excellence.
The Chinese like others have obviously fallen far short
of embodying in actual practice the high standard of their
sages. But it is certainly a gross misjudgment of Chinese
morality to say, as some writers on things Chinese have said,
that the ideal and the standard maintained are wholly disconnected.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>
This depreciatory opinion, however, admits of little
dispute if its application be confined to the mandarin class. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
public or official morality there is a deplorable divergence
between theory and practice. Probably the Chinese official
class, in spite of the stress which is laid by moralists upon the
duties of magistrates and rulers, is the most corrupt in the
world. Peculation in office is universal. Bribery is as rife as
it was in Rome under the later Republic. Justice is almost
universally bought and sold. This very general lack of integrity
in office is attributable in part at least to the inadequate
salaries. This inevitably calls into existence a system of fees
and presents, which as inevitably grows into a system of extortion,
oppression, and corruption. But, as a well-informed
writer affirms, “Whatever laxity Chinese morality may permit
in official relations, from the workingman, the tradesman, and
the servant it exacts most scrupulous honesty.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> The average
man in China, it may be confidently affirmed, is as moral—defining
morality as loyalty to an ideal—as the average man
in any other country of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Favorable effects of the ideal</div>

<p>But this general loyalty to the ideal, since this has serious
defects, has brought it about that the ideal has been an efficient
force for evil as well as for good. In some respects it
has promoted a true morality, while in others it has marred
and cramped the moral life of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>Prominent among the favorable effects of the ideal is its
exaltation of the family life. Through the emphasis laid upon
special domestic virtues, particularly that of filial piety, the
ideal has given the family such a place in the fabric of Chinese
society as has probably been given it in no other society
ancient or modern, except in that of early Rome. As the
family is the connecting link between the generations, and
consequently as a true family life must characterize every
society that shall live long on the earth, we may without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
reserve accept that interpretation of Chinese history which
finds in the exaltation of filial virtue by the sages of China
one secret of that longevity of the Chinese nation which
makes it the sole survivor among the nations from the
ancient world of culture.</p>

<p>Like the maxim of filial piety, the Confucian teaching
which makes virtue and not material prosperity the aim and
end of government has been a conservative force in Chinese
life and society. “It would be hard to overestimate,” says
Dr. Martin, “the influence which has been exerted by this
little schedule of political ethics [the Great Study], occupying,
as it has, so prominent a place in the Chinese mind for
four and twenty centuries, teaching the people to regard the
Empire as a vast family, and the Emperor to rule by moral
influence, making the goal of his ambition not the wealth
but the virtue of his subjects. It is certain that the doctrines
which it embodies have been largely efficient in rendering
China what she is, the most ancient and the most populous
of existing nations.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>In still another way has the moral ideal reacted favorably
upon Chinese civilization. We have noted the high place
in the standard of excellence assigned by the Chinese sages
to the duty of intellectual self-culture. It is scarcely to be
doubted that this emphasis laid upon learning as an important
factor in the formation of moral character has greatly fostered
learning and has been a chief agency in the creation of the
Chinese educational system with its competitive literary examinations,
which from the earliest times down almost to the
present day formed the sole gateway to public office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unfavorable effects of the ideal</div>

<p>But Confucius, while inculcating the duty of seeking wisdom,
taught his people to look for it in the past. He enjoined
them to seek the moral ideal in the life and deeds
of the ancients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>Never in the moral history of the world has the inculcation
of a specific duty had a profounder influence upon the destinies
of a people than this requirement of conformity to the
ways of the fathers has had upon the destinies of the Chinese
race. It has been one of the chief causes of the unchanging,
stereotyped character of Chinese civilization. In obedience
to the requirements of this ideal of goodness the Chinese for
two millenniums and more have made to-day like yesterday.
Hence the cycling, goalless movement of Chinese history.</p>

<p>Just as the undue emphasis laid by the Chinese moralists
upon the duty of conforming to the ways of the ancients has
reacted in some respects unfavorably upon Chinese life, so has
the exaggerated stress laid by them upon the doctrine of the
just medium exerted a similar unfavorable influence. This
has tended to produce a dull uniformity in Chinese life and
thought. The lack of lofty ideal aims has caused Chinese history
to be singularly barren in chivalric and heroic elements.
The everlasting round of routine makes life a treadmill. It
is “the prose of existence.”</p>

<p>Again, the Confucian system tends to produce a formal
morality. While it is not true, as we have seen, that
Confucianism neglects to deal with general principles, right
feelings, and motives of action, still it is true that instead
of relying upon these there is an immense multitude of
precepts and minute rules covering the smallest details of
conduct. There are three thousand rules of deportment.
This has resulted, and naturally, in the substitution of the
letter for the spirit. Even the Master has come to serve
as a pattern rather in the outer form of his life than in its
informing spirit.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>Never was there a better illustration of how the letter
killeth; for a reliance on exact rules and instructions as to
conduct in all conceivable relations and situations has made
much of Chinese morality a formal and lifeless thing. The
Chinese are governed by a sense of propriety rather than by
a sense of duty. Their morality is largely etiquette.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> It has
justly been likened to the morality of the ancient Romans in
that it makes manners and morals to be almost interchangeable
terms. Especially have the hundreds of rules prescribed
for the expression of reverence for superiors tended to empty
this part of Chinese morality of reality and sincerity, and to
make Chinese official ceremonialism one of the most curious
phases of Chinese life.</p>

<p>It would seem, further, that the very great emphasis laid
by the Chinese moralists upon the duties of children toward
their parents has prevented the normal development among
the Chinese of that ethical sentiment which among ourselves
assigns the duties of parents to infant children an important
place in the code of domestic morality. This lack among the
Chinese of any deep feeling of parental obligation results in
a widespread practice condemned by the conscience of Christian
nations. The exposure or destruction of infants prevails
in almost every province of the Republic. It is the girl babies
that are the victims of this practice.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> They are often drowned
or buried alive.</p>

<p>In this practice the subsistence motive of course is active.
It is in general the extreme poverty of the people which
causes them thus to destroy their offspring. But what renders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
this practice significant for the student of morality is the fact
that these things are done with little or no scruple of conscience,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
showing that acts respecting which the conscience
of Christian nations has become very sensitive have not yet
among the Chinese been brought generally within the circle
covered by the moral feelings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impending changes in the moral ideal</div>

<p>We have seen how the moral ideal of a people is modified
by all the changing circumstances of their life and history.
The moral ideal of the Chinese has undergone little modification
for upward of two millenniums, such, for instance, as the
ideal of the European peoples has undergone in a like period,
because throughout this long term the influences acting upon
the national life have been practically unchanged. There have
been in Chinese history no such interminglings of races,
revivals in learning, religious reformations, and political and
industrial revolutions as mark the history of the Western
nations, and responding to which the moral evolution of
these peoples has gone on apace.</p>

<p>But now that the long-continued isolation of China has
been broken, and she is being subjected to all the potent influences
of the civilization of the West, it is certain that her
social and mental life will be remolded and cast in new forms.
Sooner or later constitutional government must supersede, has
already superseded, the patriarchal government of the past;
the whole social fabric must necessarily be reconstructed and
the individual instead of the family or clan be made the social
and ethical unit;<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> the science of the Western nations will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
displace, is already displacing, the obsolete learning of the
Four Classics; Christianity will quicken the atrophied religious
consciousness of the race; and in place of the isolation
of the past there will be established those international relations
and intellectual exchanges which perhaps more than
all other agencies combined have been the motive force of
European civilization and progress.</p>

<p>This new environment, these new influences molding afresh
Chinese social, intellectual, and religious life and institutions,
cannot fail to react powerfully upon the moral ideal of the
nation. It too must inevitably undergo a great change. There
will be a shifting in the standard of character of the different
virtues, for the moral ideal of a simple patriarchal community
cannot serve as the model for a complex modern society, and
doubtless some of those virtues—as, for instance, reverence
for the past—which now hold the highest rank in the code
will exchange places with others at present held in little
esteem. Changes in the feelings and beliefs of the people
in regard to ancestor worship, which changes are inevitable,
will effect important modifications in family ethics. The substitution
of Western science for the lore of the classics will
introduce evolutionary ethics and the philosophical virtues of
the Western world; while the substitution of popular government
for the patriarchal autocracy will necessarily bring in the
ethics of democracy.</p>

<p>These certain changes in the form and content of the ancestral
ideal of goodness will not only assimilate it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
ethical standard of the Western world, but, correcting some
of its obvious shortcomings, will render it a still more effective
force in the guidance and control of the moral life of a great
and ancient people, whose day apparently is still in the future.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<span class="subhead">JAPANESE MORALS: AN IDEAL OF LOYALTY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_77a">I. <span class="smcap">Formative and Modifying Influences</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Introductory: a practically independent evolution in morals</div>

<p>In their moral evolution the Japanese people have developed
a system of morals which, notwithstanding certain defects
and limitations, is one of the noblest created by any of
the great races. A study of this system is especially interesting
and instructive for the reason that it shows how a very
admirable moral ideal may be created by a people in comparative
isolation and under influences wholly different from those
which have shaped and molded our own ideal of moral goodness.
This compels a recognition of the fact that the historian
of morals can no longer overlook or ignore the moral phenomena
of the Far East.</p>

<p>A second reason that a study of the Japanese code of morals
is important and interesting is because this ideal of worthiness
and duty has been indubitably a main factor in lifting the
Japanese nation to the high place it holds to-day among the
great nations of the earth.</p>

<p>In our examination of this system of morality we must first
note the nature of the agencies which lent to the moral ideal
its characteristic cast. Among the various forces molding and
modifying the ethical type we shall find the most important
to have been the family and clan system, ancestor worship,
the monarchy of supposed divine origin, feudalism, Confucianism,
Buddhism, and Western civilization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The family and clan system</div>

<p>As in China, so in Old Japan the family rather than the
individual was the social unit. Through the expansion of the
family arose the clan, which in the sentiments and feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
which governed its members was simply a large patriarchal
household. This organization of early Japanese society, with
the family and its outgrowth, the clan, forming the basis of
the fabric, was, as we shall learn, a potent force in the creation
of the moral type of the nation. The relationships of
the kinship group determined the duties and virtues of its
members and constituted the chief sphere of their moral
activity. Here was the nursery of Japanese morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shinto, or ancestor worship</div>

<p>The influence of religion has mingled with that of the
family sentiment. Throughout all the past the vital religious
element in the life of the Japanese peoples has been the
Shinto cult, and this is now the established religion of the
state. The system in its essence is ancestor and hero worship,
the spirits of the dead being revered as guardian divinities.
This cult has created moral feelings and family duties like
those called into existence by the same cult in China. Out
of these rudimentary family virtues, as from a central root,
have sprung many of those virtues of wider relationships
which have helped to give to the Japanese type of moral
excellence its essential features.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The monarchy of divine origin</div>

<p>The central teaching of Shinto is that the Emperor is of
divine descent and that his person is sacred and inviolate.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
This doctrine of the divine nature of the monarchy<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> has
exerted a profound influence upon the moral ideal of Japan
and has had consequences of great moment. It has made
unquestioning obedience and absolute loyalty to the Emperor
the religious duties and preëminent virtues of the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Feudalism</div>

<p>In times preceding the twelfth century there grew up in
Japan a feudal system which in many respects was remarkably
like the feudal system of medieval Europe. The unit
of the system was the clan, the members of which, forming
a close brotherhood, were bound to their lord by ties of
affection and fidelity like those which in Europe theoretically
bound the retainer to his lord.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> This system exerted a great
influence upon the moral type. It developed a martial ideal
of character known as Bushido, many of the virtues of which
are almost identical with corresponding virtues in the European
ideal of chivalry. Probably this system has had more
to do with creating in Japan a moral consciousness in many
respects like our own than has any other single agency. To
the lack in the Chinese social system of any institution like
Japanese feudalism may be ascribed in part at least the wide
difference which exists between the moral ideals of the two
peoples, especially in regard to the rank assigned the military
virtues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confucianism</div>

<p>Along with the Chinese classics Confucianism was introduced
into Japan about the middle of the sixth century of
our era, and being in perfect accord with the native system
of Shinto and with the Japanese ways of thinking, this cult
of ancestors tended to reënforce native ethical tendencies
and thus contributed essentially to make the virtues of filial
obedience and reverence for superiors prominent in the growing
type of character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhism</div>

<p>Buddhism was introduced into Japan in the sixth century
of our era. Its incoming had deep import for the moral life
of the Japanese people. It inculcated the gentler virtues, exerting
here in this respect, as elsewhere in the Far East,—save
in China, where it too quickly became shockingly degenerate,—an
influence like that exerted by Christianity in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
the Western world. It helped to make gentleness, courtesy,
and tenderness distinctive traits of the Japanese character.
Through the regard which it instilled for dumb animals it
placed the whole lower world of animal life under the protection
of the moral sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Western civilization</div>

<p>A little more than a generation ago the civilization of
Japan came into vital contact with the civilization of the West.
Almost every element of the old Japanese culture has felt
the modifying effect of this contact. The political, the economic,
the social, the domestic, and the religious institutions
have undergone or are undergoing great changes. These
changes in these departments of life and thought have caused,
as such changes always do, important modifications in ethical
sentiments and convictions. Of all the influences which for
more than two thousand years have been at work shaping and
molding the moral ideal of the Japanese nation, those now
entering from the Occidental world will doubtless leave the
deepest impress upon the ethical type.</p>

<p>In a still more direct way is this contact of Japan with
Western civilization resulting in important consequences for
Japanese morality. Christian ethics, like Buddhist ethics, is
making a strong appeal to certain classes of Japanese society.
The result is what in an earlier chapter was designated as
a “mingling of moralities” and the creation of a new composite
conscience.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_80">II. <span class="smcap">The Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Bushido</div>

<p>The heart of Japanese morality is to be sought in Bushido,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>
the ethics of the samurai. We shall best understand this
moral code by thinking of it as the Japanese ideal of chivalry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
or, perhaps better, as a blending of the Western chivalric,
Spartan, and Stoic ideals of goodness and nobility, since in
the list of virtues making up the Bushido ideal we find several
of the cardinal virtues entering into each of these three
distinct types of character.</p>

<p>As we have already intimated, Bushido is an ideal of excellence
which grew up out of the root of Japanese feudalism,
just as the Western ideal of chivalry developed out of European
feudalism. It was essentially an ideal of knighthood, the prime
virtue of which was personal loyalty to one’s superior. Fealty
to one’s chief was made so dominant a virtue that it overshadowed
all other virtues. In the defense or in the service of
his lord a samurai might commit, without offense to his sense
of moral right, practically any crime, such as blackmailing,
lying, treachery, or even murder.</p>

<p>Grouped about this cardinal virtue of loyalty were the
other knightly virtues of courage, fidelity to the plighted
word, liberality, self-sacrifice, gratitude, courtesy, and benevolence.
Liberality, or free-handedness, was carried to such
an extreme as to become a defect of character. The true
samurai must have no thought of economy and money-making.
“Ignorance of the value of different coins was a token of
good breeding.”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> To handle money was thought degrading.</p>

<p>In one respect the code of honor of the Japanese knight
was wholly unlike that of the Western knight. It did not
include any special duty to woman. “Neither God nor the
ladies inspired any enthusiasm in the samurai’s breast.”</p>

<p>The Spartan element in the samurai code appears particularly
in the training of the youth. The boy was taught always
to act from motives of duty. He was denied every comfort.
His clothing and his diet were coarse. He was allowed no
fire in the winter. “If his feet were numbed by frost, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
would be told to run about in the snow to make them warm.”
To accustom him to the sight of blood, he was taken to see
the execution of criminals; and to banish foolish fear from
his mind, he was forced to visit alone at night the place of
execution.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>The Stoic element in the ideal appears in the high place
assigned to the virtue of self-control. The samurai, like the
Stoic, must suppress all signs of his emotions. Like the Stoic,
too, he must have courage to live or courage to die, as enjoined
by duty. And his code of honor taught him what true courage
is: “It is true courage to live when it is right to live, and to
die only when it is right to die.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>This samurai ideal of character constitutes, as we shall see,
a molding force in the moral life of Japan. Bushido, it is
true, died with the passing of feudalism,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> but the spirit of
Bushido lived on. The samurai’s sense of honor and of duty
became the inheritance of the Japanese people. This great
bequest of honor and valor and of all samurai virtues is, in
the words of the author of the <i>Soul of Japan</i>, but “a trust
to the nation, and the summons of the present is to guard
this heritage, nor to bate one jot of the ancient spirit; the
summons of the future will be so to widen its scope as to
apply it in all walks and relations of life.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The virtue of loyalty to the Emperor, or patriotism</div>

<p>The belief in the divine origin of the imperial house of
Japan makes loyalty to the Emperor the supreme duty.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> During
the ascendancy of feudalism this duty, in so far as the
samurai class was concerned, was, it is true, overshadowed by
the duty of loyalty to one’s immediate feudal superior. The
sentiment due the Emperor was intercepted by the daimyos.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
But in theory loyalty to the imperial house has ever been the
paramount virtue of the Japanese. The Emperor’s command
is to his subjects as the command of God to us, and obedience
must be perfect and unquestioning. So dominant is the place
assigned this virtue of loyalty to the head of the nation that
the Japanese moralist seems almost to make morality consist
in this single virtue, as if “to fear the Emperor and to keep
his commandments” were the full duty of man.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>This sentiment of the people toward the imperial family
renders the government a sort of theocracy. Hence patriotism
with the Japanese is in large measure a religious feeling.
Indeed, patriotism has been called the religion of the Japanese.
It is this virtue, exalted to a degree which the world has never
seen surpassed, which has contributed more than any other
quality of the Japanese character to make Japan a great nation
and to give her the victory over a powerful foe in one of the
most gigantic wars of modern times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Family ethics</div>

<p>If the first duty of the Japanese is to his Emperor, his
second is to his parents. In Japanese phrase, the two virtues
of loyalty and filial piety are “the two wheels of the
chariot of Japanese ethics.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> Shinto and Confucianism, as we
have seen, have both contributed to the fostering in children
of the moral sentiments of grateful love, reverence, and obedience
toward parents and all ancestors living and dead. The
Japanese regard the high place assigned to these filial duties
in the standard of character as a mark of the vast superiority
of their morality to ours.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> The sentiments of filial affection
and reverence, coloring as they do the whole moral life, lend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
to Japanese society an ethical cast which places it in many
respects in strong contrast to the social order of the Western
nations, and makes it difficult for the Japanese to understand
us and for us to understand them.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Woman as wife and as mother</div>

<p>As respects the position of woman the family ethics of
Japan are the family ethics of the East. In a work from
every page of which breathes the spirit of the Orient, a Japanese
writer, dwelling upon the difference between the ethical
sentiments respecting family relationships which have been
evoked by the different social environments of the East and
the West, says: “In the East woman has always been worshiped
as the mother, and all those honors which the Christian
knight brought in homage to his ladylove, the samurai laid
at his mother’s feet.”<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>Lafcadio Hearn, touching upon this same feature of the
family ethics of the Japanese, declares that the Bible text,
“For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and
shall cleave unto his wife,” is, to their way of thinking and
feeling, “one of the most immoral sentences ever written.”<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>In another important respect does the domestic morality
of the Japanese differ essentially from that of the Christian
West. The family is not strictly monogamous, as with us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
The moral sense of the Japanese discerns nothing wrong in
polygamy or concubinage.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> As respects the whole relation of
marriage, the Japanese appear to be in about the same stage
of evolution as had been reached by the Hebrews at the time
of Abraham.</p>

<p>A chief virtue of the Japanese women in all their relations is
obedience to the one—whether father, or husband, or son—to
whom obedience is due. It is the setting of this duty before
all other duties that causes the Japanese women sometimes
to do what appears to us immoral, but which seems to them
truest piety and noblest self-sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> In loyalty to duty, as
they interpret duty, they maintain a standard rarely surpassed
by the women of any land.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Suicide regarded as a virtuous act</div>

<p>Suicide is infrequent among savage and barbarian races,
but is common among all peoples in an advanced stage of civilization.
It is not so much the fact itself of self-destruction
that claims the attention of the historian of morals, as the
light in which the act is viewed; that is, whether it is considered
a virtuous or a reprehensible deed.</p>

<p>Now the Japanese regard suicide, if prompted by a good
motive, as a justifiable and noble act. The motives with them
for the deed are various, as in the case of other peoples, but
among these motives is one which discloses the existence
among the Japanese of a sentiment unknown or almost unknown
among ourselves. The deed is often committed in
the way of making a solemn protest against something disapproved
of in the conduct or acts of others. Thus when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Japanese government after war with China in 1898 acceded
to the demands of Russia, France, and Germany respecting
the recession to China of certain territories on the Continent,
forty men in the Japanese army, by way of protest, committed
suicide “in the ancient way.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>Tyrannicide is also looked upon by the Japanese as an
heroic and praiseworthy deed, provided the person committing
the act makes clear the self-sacrificing and patriotic
character of his motives by at once taking his own life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Low estimation of the virtue of truthfulness</div>

<p>A marked defect of the moral standard of the Japanese is
the low place assigned to the virtue of truthfulness. Among
the Japanese, to call a person a liar is not to apply to him a
term of reproach, but rather to pay him a pleasant compliment
as a person of tact and shrewdness.</p>

<p>This lack of reverence for truth probably springs in part
from the virtue of politeness as a root. The extreme emphasis
laid upon courtesy as the sign and expression of reverence
and loyalty toward superiors fosters the general habit of saying
things which are pleasant and agreeable whether they
are true or not. This complacent disregard of truth in social
intercourse would seem to have dulled the sense of obligation
of truth-speaking in other relations.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_87">III. <span class="smcap">Some Significant Facts in the Moral History
of Japan</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">General influence of the ideal of Bushido</div>

<p>The Japanese knightly ideal, which, as we have said, constitutes
the heart and core of theoretical Japanese morality,
has a history somewhat like that of the ideal of European
knighthood. It was a lofty ideal very imperfectly realized,
yet realized to such a degree as to make it a chief motive
force in the political and social life of Japan for several centuries.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a>
It left a permanent impress upon the moral consciousness
of the Japanese nation, an impress certainly deeper
and more enduring than that left by the ideal of European
chivalry upon the moral consciousness of the peoples of
Western Europe. New Japan is directly or indirectly the
creation of Japanese knighthood.</p>

<p>We have seen that loyalty to his chief was the preëminent
virtue of the samurai. Upon the downfall of feudalism this
loyalty was transferred to the Emperor. The spirit of the
samurai came to inspire the Japanese nation. Since the time
when the loyalty of Scottish clansmen to their chief was transferred
to Scottish royalty, there has not been seen a more remarkable
example of the absolute devotion of a people to their
sovereign than that exhibited to-day by the people of Japan.</p>

<p>The samurai were taught to despise the love of gain, and
thus these knights of Japan were strangers to those vices
which spring from the love of money. To this circumstance
may be ascribed the fact that the statesmen of Japan, who
almost invariably are of the samurai class, have been so notably
free from venality and corruption.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>Finally, Bushido held aloft a high standard of truthfulness.
The true samurai regarded an oath as a derogation of his
honor. It cannot be affirmed that this Bushido virtue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
veracity has yet become the inheritance of the mercantile and
peasant classes of Japan, but it has at least been retained by
the samurai as a class, and is working to-day like leaven in
the mass of Japanese society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bushido code in action</div>

<p>There are two remarkable passages in recent Japanese
history which well illustrate in what way and to what degree
the spirit of the samurai, “the spirit of not living unto
one’s self,” has become an inspiration to the whole Japanese
nation. The first passage has to do with the Russo-Japanese
War of 1904–1905, which on the part of Japan was a struggle
for national existence. It was the samurai morality, a morality
of loyalty, of valor, of selflessness, of fidelity to duty, that
formed a chief element of the strength of Japan in that critical
juncture of the nation’s life. The Bushido code of honor
showed itself equal to the Spartan code in creating a race of
invincible warriors. Since the Spartan Leonidas and his companions
died for Greece in the pass of Thermopylæ there
has been no sublimer exhibition of fortitude and self-devotion
in a great cause than that shown by Japanese soldiers
in the trenches before Port Arthur and on the battlefields of
Manchuria.</p>

<p>This war for national independence also afforded proof of
how the gentle virtue of Japanese knighthood, courteous generosity
to the vanquished, has passed as a noble legacy to
the nation at large; for as an eminent Japanese statesman
affirms, “In the tender care bestowed upon our stricken adversary
of the battlefield will be found the ancient courtesy
of the samurai.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral standard of the samurai in competition with that of the plebeian trader</div>

<p>The second passage shows the morality of the samurai in
competition with the morality of the common Japanese shopman.
Now the morality of the plebeian Japanese trader is
about on a level with that of the ancient Greek shopkeeper.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
And a chief cause of his low moral standard is the same,
namely, the general disesteem in which the trader’s business
has been held. This social stigma has resulted in the mercantile
business being left in the hands of the lowest class
socially, intellectually, and morally.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> The great mass of the
people have from time immemorial been engaged in the honorable
business of agriculture; while the samurai class, as we
have seen, regarded it as degrading to engage in trade or
even to handle money. In these circumstances it was inevitable
that the mercantile class should evolve a very low
code of business ethics; for, as the author of <i>Bushido</i> very
justly observes, “put a stigma on a calling and its followers
adjust their morals to it.”</p>

<p>The strictly class character of this loose commercial morality
is shown by the experience of the samurai after the abolition
of feudalism in 1868. Upon that event many of them
engaged in mercantile business, carrying with them their
high moral standard, with results pathetically depicted by
Nitobé in these words: “Those who had eyes to see could
not weep enough, those who had hearts to feel could not
sympathize enough, with the fate of many a noble and honest
samurai who signally and irrevocably failed in his new and
unfamiliar field of trade and industry, through sheer lack of
shrewdness in coping with his artful plebeian rival.... It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
will be long before it will be recognized how many fortunes
were wrecked in the attempt to apply Bushido ethics to business
methods, but it was soon apparent to every observing
mind that the ways of wealth were not the ways of honor.”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>
About ninety-nine out of every hundred samurai who ventured
into business are said to have failed.</p>

<p>This passage out of the history of New Japan carries with
it various lessons, but particularly does it teach how unjust it
is to judge the morality of a people by the morality of a class.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the disastrous outcome of their first venture
into the mercantile field, the samurai still remain in
business, so that there is going on to-day in Japan in the
commercial domain a competition between two moral standards.
The triumph of the standard of the samurai over that
of the plebeian trader would mean the development in Japan
of a matchless business morality, which, in the increasing
closeness of commercial relations between the East and the
West, might well act cleansingly on our own business ethics.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral education in the schools; the Imperial Rescript</div>

<p>The rapid transformation in the institutions and ideas of
Old Japan after the revolution of 1868 created a crisis in
the moral life of the Japanese people. The old basis of the
national morality was destroyed. Reverence for the Confucian
teachings was lost. Respect for ancestral customs was seriously
impaired. Moral anarchy impended. In this critical
juncture some proposed that Buddhism, others that Christianity,
should be made the basis of the moral code.</p>

<p>Especially in the schools was the urgency of the need of
some new sanction for morality felt, because moral instruction
and training have always formed an essential part of the education
of the youth of Japan. The Japanese have ever believed
that it is possible to mold the character of the nation by education.
“With us,” says a native writer, “education has meant
moral education more than anything else for centuries.”<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
“The object of teaching,” says the official regulations for
teaching in elementary schools, “is to cultivate the moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
nature of children and to guide them in the practice of virtues.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>
Because of this central place assigned moral education
in the work of the schools, the necessity for removing
all uncertainty as to what should be inculcated was all the
more exigent.</p>

<p>To meet the crisis the following imperial rescript was
issued—certainly one of the most remarkable state papers
ever promulgated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="in0">“Know ye, our subjects:</p>

<p>“Our imperial ancestors have founded our Empire on a basis broad
and everlasting and have deeply and firmly implanted virtue; our subjects,
ever united in loyalty and filial piety, have from generation to generation
illustrated the beauty thereof. This is the glory and the fundamental
character of our Empire, and herein also lies the source of our education.
Ye, our subjects, be filial to your parents, affectionate to your brothers
and sisters; as husbands and wives be harmonious; as friends true;
bear yourselves in modesty and moderation; extend your benevolence to
all; pursue learning and cultivate arts, and thereby develop intellectual
faculties and perfect moral powers; furthermore, advance public good
and promote common interests; always respect the Constitution and observe
the laws; should emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously
to the state; and thus guard and maintain the prosperity of our imperial
throne coeval with heaven and earth. So shall ye not only be our
good and faithful subjects, but render illustrious the best traditions of
your forefathers.</p>

<p>“The way here set forth is indeed the teaching bequeathed by our
imperial ancestors, to be observed alike by their descendants and the
subjects, infallible for all ages and true in all places. It is our wish to
lay it to heart in all reverence, in common with you, our subjects, that
we may all thus attain to the same virtue.</p>

<p>“The 30th day of the 10th month of the 23d year of Meiji” [1890].<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>
</div>

<p>It would be almost impossible to exaggerate the influence
of this imperial edict. “Our whole moral education,” affirms
Baron Kikuchi, “consists in instilling into the minds of our
children the proper appreciation of the spirit of this rescript.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
The children learn it by heart just as the Roman children
committed to memory the Twelve Tables of the laws.</p>

<p>Japanese believe that the effect of this instruction upon the
national character, reënforcing the ancestral virtues of loyalty
and devotion to duty, was exhibited in the recent war with
Russia.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<p>A noteworthy feature of the rescript is that it is simply
a reaffirmation of the teachings of the ancient moralists
and the ethical traditions of the fathers—an inculcation of
those virtues of loyalty and filial piety which the Japanese
people have held in esteem and practiced from generation
to generation.</p>

<p>A second feature of the edict which arrests attention is
the universalistic and secular character of the morality inculcated.
The virtues enjoined are universal benevolence, loyalty
to duty, and self-devotion to the common good—a morality
of the universal human heart and conscience, a morality, as
the edict declares, good for all ages and for all places.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Japanese morals and Western civilization</div>

<p>The foregoing anticipates and gives answer to the questions:
What will be the effect upon Japanese morality of
those changes now going on in the life and thought of Japan
through contact with the civilization of the West? What will
be the effect upon Japanese public morality when the common
belief in the divine descent of the Emperor, which is
the root from which springs the primal duty of loyalty, is
undermined, as modern science is certain to undermine it?
What will be the effect upon Japanese domestic morality when
Occidental conceptions of the family and of woman’s place in
it come to modify, as they seem likely to do, those ideas and
sentiments which from time immemorial have formed the
basis of the family ethics of the East? What will be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
ethical consequences when Western science renders obsolete
the Shinto learning and the Confucian classics, which have
hitherto formed the basis of so large a part of Japanese
morality? What will be the effect upon the ancient ideal
of character of the adoption of Christian ideas and teachings
in place of those which have so long nourished the ethical
feelings and sentiments of the Japanese people?</p>

<p>That the intrusion into the ancient culture of Japan of
these various elements of Western civilization has deep import
for Japanese morality cannot be made a matter of doubt.
In the new environment, so different from that in the midst
of which the ancient ideal of goodness was developed, this
ideal must inevitably undergo important changes. Some of
those qualities of character which have so long held high
places in the ideal of excellence will cease to evoke the old-time
homage, while other qualities at present assigned low
places in the standard will be exalted. Virtues now practically
unrecognized by the Japanese as virtues, but which among
us are highly esteemed moral qualities, will certainly be incorporated
in the modified ideal, giving it a new cast, yet
probably without changing fundamentally the type; for the
moral life of the Japanese people is too virile and too essentially
sound to permit us to think that the new influences now
coming in will produce such radical changes in the ethical feelings
and convictions of the race as to result in a repetition of
what happened upon the entrance of Christianity into the morally
decadent Greco-Roman world—the displacement of the
old ideal of character by a new and essentially different ideal.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ETHICAL IDEALS OF INDIA</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_95a"><span class="larger">PART I. THE ETHICS OF BRAHMANISM—A CLASS
MORALITY</span></h3>

<h3 id="toclink_95b">I. <span class="smcap">Historical and Speculative Basis of the System</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The conception of the First Cause&#8203;— &#8203;Brahma</div>

<p>As in Judea so in India the conception formed of the
Supreme Being reacted potently upon morality. Hence in
naming the influences under which the moral ideal of Brahmanism
was molded we must speak first of the Indian
conception of the First Cause.</p>

<p>The Aryan conquerors of India originally held notions of
the gods in general like those held by their kinsmen, the early
Greeks and Romans. When they entered India they were
ancestor worshipers and polytheists. They had earth gods
and sky gods. The gods of the celestial phenomena gradually
acquired ascendancy. Then, as in Egypt, there came a
tendency toward unity. The various gods came to be looked
upon by the loftier minds as merely different manifestations
of one primal being.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>It is right at this point that we find the great antithesis
between Indian modes of thought and those of all or almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
all other peoples. When the thinkers of Egypt, of the Semitic
lands, of Persia, of Greece and Rome, had at last through
reflection evolved the lofty conception of a single great First
Cause, they endowed this cause with conscious personal life.
This mode of thought is our heritage from the past. It is to
us almost or quite impossible to conceive of conscious personal
life as springing from an unconscious impersonal cause.
Hence we place behind the manifold phenomena of the universe
a conscious personal being as the origin and source of
all things and all life.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<p>It is wholly different with the thinkers of India. They
seem to be able to postulate as the beginning of things
an impersonal cause, a cause without perception, thought, or
consciousness. They affirm that out of unconsciousness consciousness
arises. They teach that out of Brahma, the unconscious,
impersonal, passionless One, emanate all material
worlds and sentient beings, gods as well as men.</p>

<p>How profoundly this conception of the First Cause has
reacted on the ethical speculations of the Hindu sages and
on the moral life of India will appear a little further on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The god Brahma (Brahman)</div>

<p>But this incomprehensible, unconscious, passionless Brahma
is not the Brahma of the popular faith. The masses and
even the philosophers themselves must have something more
concrete. So this impersonal, neuter Brahma is conceived
as giving existence to the personal, masculine God Brahma
(Brahman), “the progenitor of all worlds, the first-born
among beings.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p>It is very necessary for the student of Brahmanic ethics to
keep in mind the distinction between the uncreated, unconditioned,
impersonal Brahma and the created, conditioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
personal Brahma, since there is here laid the foundation of
a double goal for rational moral striving: the goal of the ascetic
whose ultimate aim is deliverance from individual existence
and absorption into the absolute, unchangeable, impersonal
Brahma, which means a state of eternal unconsciousness—dreamless
sleep; and the goal of the multitude, whose hope
and aim is blissful, though temporary, union with the personal
Brahma in the heaven of the mortal, conditioned gods.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The system of castes</div>

<p>The ethical evolution in India was also profoundly influenced
by a prehistoric event, namely, the subjection of the
original non-Aryan population of the land by an intruding
Aryan people. As a result of the long and bitter struggle the
two races became separated by a sharp line of race prejudice
and hatred. The dark-skinned natives were reduced to a state
of servitude or dependence upon their conquerors. Intermarriages
between the two races were strictly prohibited, and thus
the population of the conquered districts of the peninsula became
divided into two sharply defined classes. These constituted
a model upon which Indian society was framed. Other
classes were formed, and these gradually hardened into castes,
that is, into classes between which marriages were prohibited.
Four great castes arose: namely, priests or Brahmans, warriors
and rulers, peasants and merchants, and sudras. Below
these castes were the pariahs, or outcasts, made up of the
most degraded of the natives. As time passed, still other
divisions were formed, every occupation coming to constitute
the basis of a new caste, till society was stratified like a
geologic deposit.</p>

<p>Religion came in to consecrate this division of the people
into privileged and nonprivileged classes.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> The sacred scriptures
declare that the Brahmans sprang from the mouth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Brahma, the warriors from his arms, the peasants and traders
from his thighs, and the sudras from his feet.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>No institution known among men ever exercised a more
fateful and sinister influence upon morality than this caste
system has exercised upon the morality of the peoples of
India. The rooted belief and dogma of the natural inequality
of men has made Brahmanic ethics a thing of grades and
classes, and has thus rendered impossible the evolution of a
true morality, which requires for its basis genuine sentiments
of equality and brotherhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of transmigration</div>

<p>We easily realize the importance for morality of a belief
in a life after death. But a belief in preëxistence may exert
an even greater influence upon the moral code of a people
than a belief in post-existence.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> Now the morality of the
Hindus has been molded by both these doctrines, for according
to the teachings of Brahmanism a man has lived
through many lives before his “birth,” and may wander
through “ten thousand millions of existences” after death
has freed him from his present body.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> The class and the condition
into which he is born here on earth is believed to be
determined by the sum total of his merits or demerits earned
in preceding existences. As a result of sin he may in his next
birth be reborn in a lower caste, or may be imprisoned in
some animal or vegetable form. He may pass a thousand
times through the bodies of spiders, snakes, and lizards, and
hundreds of times through the forms of grasses, shrubs, and
creepers. And all this experience may come after the soul
has passed through dreadful and innumerable hells for vast
cycles of years.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>This transmigration theory was framed by the thinkers of
India to explain among other things the seemingly unjust
inequalities of human life.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> It afforded an explanation why
one man should be born a Brahman and another a sudra,
one born in a hovel and another in a palace, by conceiving
the place of every person born into the world as being determined
by the manner of his life in former existences.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to dwell upon the profound influence
which this doctrine of transmigration, or round of births,
has exerted upon the moral life of India. The tendency of
this theory, as soon as elaborated, was to render still more
intolerable the position of the lower castes, particularly that
of the sudras, since it made their low place and hard lot to
be the merited punishment of crimes and misdoings in previous
lives; while at the same time it fed the pride and enhanced
the arrogance of the Brahmans, since their superior lot was,
according to the theory, attributable to merit acquired in other
existences. Thus did the theory tend to give a more sinister
aspect to the baneful caste system, to make it appear a part
of the unchangeable order of things, and to render impossible
the growth of any other than a class morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian pessimism</div>

<p>Hardly less important than the doctrine of transmigration
for Hindu morality is the Indian conception of life—of all individual,
conscious existence whether here on earth or in other
worlds—as inseparable from misery, pain, decay, and death.</p>

<p>The Aryan immigrants into India seem to have been, like
their kinsmen the Greeks, a light-hearted folk, filled with a
strong joy in life. But as in their journeyings they pressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
southward into the valleys of the Indus and the Ganges and
came under the influences of the hot, depressing climate, and
of an oppressive social and political system,<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> they appeared
to have lost their buoyant spirits. The skies seemed less
bright and life less worth living, and, weary of it all, they at
last came to regard eternal death, annihilation, as the greatest
of boons.</p>

<p>This pessimistic view of the world and of life, as we shall
see a little further on, forms the basis of large sections of
Indian ethics, since it makes the ultimate goal of rational or
moral effort to be the getting rid of conscious existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conception of sacrifice</div>

<p>Another conception which has exerted a profound influence
upon the religious ethics of Brahmanism is that respecting
sacrifice. This conception is that the gods need sustenance,
and can only exist through the gifts and offerings made to
them by men.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> “The gods live by sacrifice” say the sacred
scriptures; “the sun would not rise if the priests did not
make sacrifice.”</p>

<p>To understand this teaching we must connect it with the
belief of primitive man that the spirits of the dead have absolute
need of meat and drink offerings at the hands of the
living, and remember that in India there is no sharp distinction
drawn between the gods and the souls of men. The gods,
like the spirits of the dead, are dependent for life and strength
upon the offerings laid on their altars. Without these gifts
they would die or pine away, and all the movements of the
universe controlled by them would cease.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>From this conception of the gods came the emphasis laid
by Brahmanism upon sacrifice, and the prominence given the
religious duty of bringing rich gifts to the priests and keeping
the altars of the gods heaped with food.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_101">II. <span class="smcap">The Various Moral Standards</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">A class morality</div>

<p>The fundamental fact of Brahmanic morality is that as a result
of the caste system it is a class morality; that is, there is a
different moral standard or code for each of the different castes.</p>

<p>In the account given in the <i>Laws of Manu</i> of the origin
of the four chief castes, the occupation and the duties of each
class are carefully prescribed. To the Brahman was assigned
teaching and offering sacrifice; to the warriors and rulers the
protection of the people; to the peasants and merchants the
tilling of the ground and trading; and to the sudras—“One
occupation only,” reads the sacred law, “is prescribed to the
sudra, to serve meekly the other three castes.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>The Brahman is by right the lord of the whole creation.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>
His name must express something auspicious, but the first part
of the sudra’s name must express something contemptible,
and the second part must be a word denoting service.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>For a man of a lower caste to affect equality with a person
of a higher caste is a crime: “If a man of an inferior caste,
proudly affecting an equality with a man of superior caste,
should travel by his side on the road, or sit or sleep upon the
same carpet with him, the magistrate shall take a fine from
the man of inferior caste to the extent of his ability.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p>For a Brahman to explain to a sudra the sacred Vedas is
a sin: “Let him [the Brahman] not give to a sudra advice
nor the remnants of his meal ...; nor let him explain the
sacred law to such a man; ... for he who explains the sacred
law to such ... will sink together with that man into hell.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>In the matter of punishments for crimes the laws are
grossly unequal, the punishment of a person of inferior caste
being always more severe than that of a person of a superior
caste for the same offense. Thus for a crime punishable with
death if committed by a person of an inferior caste, tonsure
only is ordained if committed by a Brahman;<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> for a Brahman
must never be slain, “though he have committed all horrible
crimes.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> There is no crime in all the world as great as that
of slaying a Brahman.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>A knowledge of the inequality of these sacred laws of the
Brahmans and the burdensomeness of this caste morality as
it pressed upon the lower classes is necessary to an understanding
of the rise and rapid spread of Buddhism, and the
fervor with which its teachings of equality and brotherhood
were embraced by the masses of Brahmanic India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The highest moral excellence attainable in general only by Brahmans</div>

<p>Of the different standards of morality of the several castes
that of the Brahman is of course the highest. The study of
the sacred books is for him the chief duty. “Let him,”
says the sacred law, “without tiring daily mutter the Veda
at the proper time; for that is one’s highest duty; all other
observances are secondary duties.”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> Knowledge of the Veda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
destroys guilt as fire consumes fuel.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Among the secondary
duties are observance of the rules of purification, the practice
of austerities, and doing no injury to created beings.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></p>

<p>By austerities, that is, by ascetic practices, by hideous self-torture,
the Brahman may atone for all sins of whatsoever
kind and may become so holy that at death, having conquered
all desires, save only the desire for union with the Universal
One, he may hope to fall away into unawakening unconsciousness
and be absorbed into the absolute, impersonal Brahma,
and thus escape forever from the weary round of births. This
way of full salvation, and it is the only one, is open only to
Brahmans and to the chosen few from other castes who,
having gone forth “from home into homelessness,” as mendicants
or forest hermits, follow this life of complete renunciation
of all that is earthly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral code for inferior castes</div>

<p>The duties, the faithful performance of which avail most
for persons of inferior castes, are those that have to do with
religion, and chiefly with sacrifice. These duties are the
bringing of gifts and offerings for the sacrifices and the
giving of generous fees to the priests. Through the faithful
performance of his assigned duties the man of inferior caste
can make sure of salvation—not the full and perfect salvation
attained by the Brahman through his austerities, but a qualified
salvation. He may hope for rebirth in some higher caste
or in some better state either on earth or in some other world.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Animal ethics</div>

<p>Duty to animals seems to have formed no part of the moral
code of the early Indian Aryans. But chiefly through the influence
of the doctrine of transmigration respect for every
living thing became a high moral requirement. To take life
wantonly became a crime. To kill a kine, a horse, a camel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
a deer, an elephant, a goat, a sheep, a fish, a snake, a buffalo,
insects, or birds is an offense which must be expiated by
penances.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>In order that he may not harm any living creature, the
ascetic is enjoined “always by day and by night, even with
pain to his body, to walk carefully, scanning the ground.”<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>
Should he unintentionally injure any creature he must expiate
its death by penitent austerities.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p>Animals may, however, be slain for food<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> and for sacrifices,
since they were created for these special purposes. And then
there is compensation for the victims of the altars: “Herbs,
trees, cattle, birds, and all animals that have been destroyed
for sacrifices receive, being reborn, higher existences.”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<p>The killing of animals for sport is an inexpiable sin: “He
who injures innoxious beings from a wish to (give) himself
pleasure never finds happiness, neither living nor dead.”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>Under the influence of Buddhism we shall see this consideration
for animal life deepening into a genuine tenderness
for every living creature, and duties toward the inferior animals
becoming one of the most beautiful and characteristic
features of the ethical ideal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">War ethics</div>

<p>In Brahmanic as in Confucian ethics the military virtues
are assigned a low place. Brahmanism, however, concedes
the legitimacy of war and permits the employment of force
by the king in augmenting his possessions,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> even enjoining
upon him to be ever ready to strike; for “of him who is
always ready to strike, the whole world stands in awe.”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>But the genuine spirit of Brahmanism is opposed to the
fierce war spirit of the Aryan conquerors of India, and the
sacred law attempts to ameliorate the cruelties and atrocities
of primeval warfare, instilling in the warrior a spirit of magnanimity
and chivalry. Thus the “blameless law for the warrior”
forbids to him the use of barbed or poisoned weapons;
he must spare the suppliant for mercy; he must not strike
an enemy who has lost his armor or whose weapons are
broken, or who has received a wound, or who has turned in
flight. He must do no harm to the onlooker. The king must
conduct war without guile or treachery.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural morality versus ritualism</div>

<p>At the heart of Brahmanism, as at the heart of every other
great religion of the world, there is a core of lofty spiritual
teachings and true morality. The sacred scriptures of the
Brahmans declare, “The soul itself is the witness of the
soul, and the soul is the refuge of the soul; despise not thy
own soul, the supreme witness of men.”<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>The sacred law teaches that he is pure who is pure in
thought and in deed: “Among all modes of purification, purity
in (the acquisition of) wealth is declared to be the best; for
he is pure who gains wealth with clean hands, not he who
purifies himself with earth and water.”<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>Repentance and resolutions of amendment free the soul
from its transgressions: “He who has committed a sin and
has repented, is freed from that sin, but he is purified only
by the resolution of ceasing to sin and thinking I will do so
no more.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p>Brahmanism teaches the duty of forgiving injuries and of
returning blessings for curses: “Against an angry man let
him [the ascetic] not in return show anger; let him bless when
he is cursed.”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> “A king must always forgive litigants, infants,
aged and sick men, who inveigh against him.”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> “He who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
being abused by men in pain, pardons them, will in reward
of that act be exalted in heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p>Here is a morality as pure and lofty as any taught by Hebrew
prophets. But as in Judaism, so in Brahmanism, such was
the stress laid by the priests upon sacrifice, upon the observance
of the rites and ceremonies of the temple, and upon the
performance of a thousand and one morally indifferent acts,
that as time passed there resulted an almost complete overshadowing
of natural by ritual morality. It was such a triumph
of ritualism as marked the postexilic period in the history of
Israel. As there came a protest and reaction in Judea issuing
in Christianity, so did there come a protest and reaction in
Brahmanic India issuing in Buddhism.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_106"><span class="larger">PART II. THE ETHICS OF BUDDHISM; AN IDEAL OF
SELF-CONQUEST AND UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE</span></h3>

<h3 id="toclink_106a">I. <span class="smcap">The Philosophical Basis of the System</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The four great truths</div>

<p>Four tenets or principles, called the four truths, sum up
the essentials of Buddhism.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> These are the truth of pain, the
origin of pain, the destruction of pain, and the eightfold way
that “leads to the quieting of pain.”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>The first three of these truths form the philosophical basis
of Buddhist ethics, and to a brief exposition of these tenets we
shall devote the immediately following sections. The fourth
truth is a summary of the ethics of Buddhism,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
what we shall have to say about it will appropriately find a
place under the next subdivision of this chapter when we
come to speak of the moral ideal of Buddhism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The truth of pain</div>

<p>The truth of pain, in the language of the sacred scriptures,
is this: “Birth is pain, death is pain, clinging to earthly
things is pain.”</p>

<p>This is simply an expression, with added emphasis, of that
world-weariness, of that despair of life, which we have seen
pressing like an incubus upon the spirit of Brahmanic India.
Buddhism teaches that life is an evil, that misery and sorrow
and pain are inseparable from all modes of existence. We
shall be able to get the Buddhist’s point of view if we bear
in mind how we ourselves sometimes look upon this earthly
life. In despondent moods we ask, “Is life worth living?”
and make answer ourselves by declaring that if this earthly
life is all, then there is in it nothing worth while. If now we
extend this gloomy view so as to make it embrace the life to
come as well as the life that now is, we shall have the viewpoint
of the true Buddhist. To him life not only in this world
but in all other possible worlds is transitory, illusive, and painful,
and in utter despair and weariness he longs to be through
with it all and to lay down forever the intolerable burden of
existence.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> “As the glow of the Indian sun causes rest in
cool shades to appear to the wearied body the good of goods,
so also with the wearied soul, rest, eternal rest, is the only
thing for which it craves.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The origin of pain</div>

<p>The truth of the origin of pain is this: “It is the thirst
for life, together with lust and desire, which causes birth and
rebirth.”</p>

<p>It should be noted here that there are different interpretations
given to this tenet. Some understand by it not that all
desires, but simply evil desires, cause and feed the flame of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
life; others interpret it as teaching that desires or longings
of every kind whatsoever possess this sinister potency of recreating
life and keeping one entangled in the meshes of the
net of existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The truth of the destruction of pain</div>

<p>The truth of the destruction of pain is this: “Pain can
be ended only by the complete extinction of desire.” Desire
being the root which feeds life and causes the round of births,
existence can be ended only by getting rid of desire.</p>

<p>Here again there are different acceptations of the dogma.
To most it means simply the getting rid of all unholy passions
and desires, while to the thoroughgoing Buddhist it means
freedom from every desire of whatsoever kind: “Not a few
trees but the whole forest” of desires must be cut down,
together with all “the undergrowth.”<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of karma</div>

<p>Besides these three philosophical principles,—the truth of
pain, the origin of pain, and the extinction of pain,—there are
two other speculative doctrines of orthodox Buddhism, a comprehension
of which is necessary to an understanding of the
ethics of the system. The first of these is the doctrine of
karma. This is a denial of the soul theory. Orthodox Buddhism
denies that man has a soul separable from the body.
It teaches that when a person dies there does not go out of
his body a spirit which lives elsewhere a conscious life, a
continuation of the life just ended, but that all that goes out
is <em>karma</em>, that is, something which is the net product of all
the good and evil acts of the person in all his various existences—a
sort of seed or germ from which will spring up here
on earth or in some heaven or hell another being.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
no conscious identity, however, between the two beings. They
stand related to each other as father to son.</p>

<p>Some illustrations will help us to seize the thought. The
Buddhist teacher likens the relation of the life going out
here to the new life beginning elsewhere, to the relation of
two candle flames, the second of which has been lighted from
the first. Through the transmission of karma the flame of
life is passed on from one being to another; but all these
life flames are different. No abiding self-consciousness binds
them together and makes them one. Again, this succession
of lives is likened to the undulations of a wave in the ocean.
The successive undulations are not the same, yet the first
causes the second, the second the third, and so on.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the important place this doctrine holds in
Buddhist speculative philosophy and theoretical ethics, it was
neither understood nor adopted by the masses. It was developed
in the schools, but the people in general held to their
old Brahmanic belief in the soul and its transmigrations, so
that in most Buddhist lands to-day belief in a conscious personal
existence after death is the prevailing one.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nirvana and the different senses in which the term is used</div>

<p>The other philosophical doctrine of which we have to speak
is that of Nirvana. This term is used with many different
meanings. Often it denotes merely the extinguishment in the
soul of lust and hate and ignorance, and the state of quiet
contentment and blissful repose which results from such self-mastery.
Buddha himself, says Rhys Davids, meant by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
term just what Christ meant by the kingdom of God, that
kingdom within the soul of calm and abiding peace.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p>Again, it is used to express a state of eternal, unchanging,
blissful rest and ineffable peace beyond all the realms—heavens
and hells—of transmigration.</p>

<p>Still again the term is used to denote the absolute extinction
of existence, annihilation. This is the view of Nirvana
held to-day by the Buddhists of Ceylon, Siam, and Burma
who claim to hold the ancient faith in its primitive purity.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_110">II. <span class="smcap">The Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The truth of the eightfold path</div>

<p>The ethics of Buddhism is summed up in the formula
of the truth of the eightfold path.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> The truth of the eight-membered
way is this: the only path which leads to the quieting
of pain is the eightfold holy path—right belief, right
resolve, right speech, right behavior, right occupation, right
effort, right thought, right concentration.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<p>The essence of all this expressed in familiar ethical phrase
is that the demands of morality are right thoughts, right
words, and right deeds. As the eight requirements are interpreted
and expounded by Buddhist teachers, they demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
a mind free from all evil passions and unholy desires (and,
according to the thoroughgoing Buddhist, of every desire
whatsoever)<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> and “a heart of love far-reaching, grown great,
and beyond measure.” This is the path leading to deliverance
from transmigration, this the path leading to the quieting
of pain, this the path leading to the sweet rest and peace
of Nirvana.</p>

<p>It will be worth our while to note with some attention
some of the special primary duties and virtues which are
included in these general demands of self-conquest and
unmeasured love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Particular virtues and duties of the ideal</div>

<p>One of the primary duties of the true Buddhist is to seek
knowledge, for true knowledge, insight, is the cure for desire.
This knowledge which quenches all craving thirst is best attained,
so Buddha taught, through meditation.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> One must
meditate on the transitoriness of life, on pain, on death, on
truth, on gentleness, on love. It was through profound meditation
under the Bo tree that Gautama became the Buddha,
“The Enlightened.”</p>

<p>Another cardinal virtue of the Buddhist ideal of character
is universal benevolence. By no other ethical system has
such stress been laid upon the duty of gentleness to everything
that has life. The animal world is here brought within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
the sanctuary of morality and safeguarded by ethical sentiment.
It is of course the doctrine of transmigration, which Buddhism
inherits from Brahmanism, which gives animal ethics the
prominent place it holds in Buddhist morality.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p>Still a third requirement of the true Buddhist is toleration,
which follows as a corollary from the virtue of universal benevolence.
In the prominent place assigned this virtue in the
ideal of character, Buddhism stands alone among the great
world religions.</p>

<p>A fourth cardinal duty of the ideal is to make known to all
men the eightfold way to salvation. Buddha’s command to
his disciples was, “Go ye now and preach the most excellent
Law, explaining every point thereof, unfolding it with diligence
and care.” This is a duty which brings its own reward;
for the exercise of compassion and charity produces that serenity
of spirit which is the aim of moral striving; and hence
nothing advances one more rapidly on the way to salvation
than preaching the good tidings and laboring to lessen the
sorrows and lighten the burdens of one’s fellow creatures.
The moral requirement to preach to all the most excellent
way made of Buddhism a missionary religion. In a few
centuries after the death of Buddha devoted missionaries
had spread the new faith throughout the Far East.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The different degrees of moral attainment</div>

<p>There are in Buddhism three grades of moral attainment.
The lowest is that which may be reached by any one in the
ordinary life. Through purity of thought and word and deed,
through the exercise of universal kindliness, and by the fulfillment
of every duty pertaining to his station in life, one attains
such a degree of moral excellence that he may at least hope
at death to avoid painful rebirth.</p>

<p>The second degree of moral excellence is that attained by
the monk of Gautama’s Order. The idea of the Buddhist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
here is like that of the Christian respecting the monastic life.
For centuries in the West the ascetic life was looked upon as
more perfect than the ordinary life, and as the better and
surer way to salvation. It is the same in Buddhist lands.
The goal striven after, the extinction of unholy desires, the
Buddhist believes is most quickly and surely reached by him
who has rid himself of the cares and worries of domestic life,
and withdrawn from all the distractions of the world.</p>

<p>The prime duty of the Buddhist monk is meditation, which
takes the place of prayer in the code of the Christian recluse.
Through following faithfully and patiently all the rules of the
Order he may hope to attain such comparative perfection
that at his death he will be reborn in some better state.</p>

<p>The third and highest degree of moral attainment can be
reached only in the Arhatship. The Arhat is what we would
call the perfect man. He is one who, like the Buddha, reaches
a state of perfect insight or mental illumination and of perfect
freedom from all desires<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> save the desire for Nirvana. This
state is reached only through absolute renunciation of the
world. He who would be perfect must leave all earthly pleasures
behind, and calling nothing his own, with all appetites
stilled, passionless and desireless, go out from home into
homelessness.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> In such a one karma becomes extinct, and
for him there are no new births. “The living, moving body
of the perfect man is visible still,” says Rhys Davids in explaining
this state, ... “but it will decay and die and pass
away, and as no new body will be formed, where life was,
will be nothing.”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The genuine altruism of Buddhist ethics</div>

<p>It is impossible to conceive a higher altruism than that inculcated
by the higher thoroughgoing Buddhism. Since it
denies the existence of the soul,—nothing save the seed
(karma) of another but different life remaining at death,—when
one strives to break the chain of existence, to make an
end of the weary cycle of births, such a one is seeking good
not for himself but for another. In the words of Dr. Hopkins,
“It is to save from sorrow this son of one’s acts that one
should seek to find the end.”<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> Thus orthodox Buddhism
alone, of all the great ethical systems of history, refuses to
sully virtue with promises of reward. Its morality stands absolutely
alone, unsupported by the hope of recompense either
in this world or in the world to come. “Buddhism alone
teaches that to live on earth is weariness, that there is no
bliss beyond, and that one should yet be calm, pure, loving,
and wise.”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<p>Another thing especially noteworthy regarding the ethics
of Buddhism is that it is the ethics of naturalism. “For the
first time in the history of the world,” in the words of Rhys
Davids, “Buddhism proclaimed a salvation which each man
could gain for himself and by himself in this world, during
this life, without the least reference to God or the gods, either
great or small.” In this respect Buddhism is somewhat like
the present-day socialism of the materialistic school, which
ardently proclaims justice, equity, and universal brotherhood,
but says nothing about God.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_115">III. <span class="smcap">Some Expressions of the Ethical
Spirit of Buddhism</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Introductory</div>

<p>Buddhism has been called the Christianity of the Orient.
Like Christianity, it has been a great moralizing force in history.
Its ethical ideal has been just such a factor in the moral
life of the East as the ethical ideal of Christianity has been
in the moral life of the West.</p>

<p>To portray even in scantiest outline the influence of this
ideal upon the different peoples who have accepted it as their
standard of goodness, or whose moral codes have felt its modifying
effects, would lead us far beyond the limits of our work.
In what follows we shall aim at nothing more—after having
first remarked the ethical kinship of the Buddhist reform
with other contemporary reform movements—than to note
briefly the practical outworkings of the ideal in three or four
departments of the moral domain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethical relationships of the Buddhist reform</div>

<p>We shall understand best the import for the moral evolution
of humanity of that remarkable revolution in Brahmanic India
which resulted in the establishment of Buddhism throughout
the peninsula and in other countries of the Far East, if
we first notice its ethical kinship with other reform movements
which, about the close of the sixth pre-Christian century,
make a dividing line in the inner histories of so many
of the progressive societies and cultures of that age.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>In Greece Pythagoreanism was rising. This movement was
in its essential spirit a social and moral reform. It was an attempt
to introduce a true ethics in Greek city life, and to find a
basis for morality in the deep intuitions of the human soul.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>In Israel the Isaiah of the Exile was proclaiming the loftiest
ethical doctrines ever taught by Hebrew prophet, and in his
interpretation of the moral government of Yahweh was scattering
the seed from which was to spring up a new ethical
life among men.</p>

<p>In Persia the great teacher Zarathustra (Zoroaster), with
like vision of moral things, was declaring to the followers of
Ahura Mazda that what God requires of men is purity of
purpose, truthfulness in word and act, and unceasing warfare
against evil within and without.</p>

<p>In China the Master, Confucius, reaffirming the teachings of
antiquity, was inculcating essentially the same truth—that the
sum of true morality is reverence, obedience, and right living.</p>

<p>It probably would be unhistorical to suppose that there
was any actual connection between these several ethical or
religious reform movements in these widely separated lands.
They are brought together here merely that they may be used
to interpret one another in terms of ethical progress, and that
they may bear witness to the substantial oneness of the expressions
of the moral faculty of man in response to the same
or similar intellectual and social stimulus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethical content for the masses of Buddha’s message</div>

<p>The question naturally arises, How could Buddha’s dismal
doctrine of annihilation as the ultimate aim and end of
moral striving—for this dogma was undoubtedly one of the
fundamental principles of primitive Buddhism—ever have
been received by the multitude as a word of consolation and
hope? What is there of ethical authority or appeal in such
a doctrine to constitute it the motive force in a great popular
moral reform? The answer is that although Buddha himself
probably believed that death for the perfect man meant absolute
extinction of being, nevertheless he lay no emphasis upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
this part of his world philosophy. He knew very well that it
would be a hard doctrine for many to receive, and when questioned
about it he was reticent. It was his other doctrine, the
way in which one may escape painful rebirths, upon which
Buddha laid the stress of his teaching. And here his simple
word to the people was this: Be gentle and merciful and
just; get rid of all impure and craving desires, and then at
death, instead of suffering some painful rebirth, you will be
reborn into a happier condition here on earth or in some other
world. In a word, he said, Follow after goodness and it will
be well with you.</p>

<p>To be able to understand how this simple word should be
received with such enthusiasm by the multitude, we need to
bear in mind how hard the way of escape from painful rebirths
had been made by the Brahmans. They had taught the people
that salvation was possible only through ritual and ceremony,
through costly offerings to the gods, through the payment of
liberal fees to the priests, through penances and ascetic practices.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a>
Thus the way of deliverance had been made so hard
that few could follow it, and so unethical that it left the heart
cold and the conscience unsatisfied.</p>

<p>The situation was like that in Judea when the greatest of
the prophets, in opposition to the teachings of the scribes and
Pharisees who were laying upon men’s shoulders a burden
of ritualism too heavy to be borne, declared that man finds
salvation not through ritual or sacrifice, but through humility,
obedience, and love—and the people heard him gladly and
followed him, because his yoke was easy and his burden light.</p>

<p>So was it in India. Buddha interprets anew to men the
divine message that all which is required of them is purity
and justice and tenderness toward all creatures. The spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
of the heavy-burdened multitude witnesseth with the spirit
of the Prophet that this is indeed a true and divine Word;
and Buddhism, with its ethical enthusiasms and fresh hopes,
marks a new era in the moral evolution of the peoples of
the Eastern world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monasticism as an ethical expression of Buddhism</div>

<p>In explaining the different degrees of moral attainment
possible to the Buddhist, we spoke of the monastic ideal of
virtue. This part of Buddhist ethical theory has left a deep
impress upon practical morality in all those lands into which
the faith of the Buddha has spread. Monasticism has been,
and is still to-day, just such a dominant factor in the moral
life of all Buddhist communities of eastern Asia as it was in
the moral life of medieval Christian Europe.</p>

<p>The causes that fostered the upgrowth of the system in
the East were essentially the same as those that fostered its
development in the West. Among these causes a prominent
place must be assigned that feeling of world-weariness
to which we have already more than once referred, a feeling
evoked by the burden and ache of existence. It was this
predisposition of spirit that caused the doctrine of renunciation
of the world preached by the disciples of Buddha to
appeal with such persuasion to multitudes throughout all the
Eastern lands.</p>

<p>We may stop to note but one of various points of difference
between Buddhist and Christian monasticism. The latter,
in general, recognized the ethical value of labor. This feeling
found expression in various forms of activity among the monks,
particularly in agricultural labor and in the work of the scriptorium.
It was this which not only helped to keep life in
the Western monasteries morally wholesome for a period, but
which also made the monastic system such an efficient force
in the conquest and redemption of the waste lands of Europe
and in the upbuilding of Western civilization in the early
medieval age. Now Buddhist monasticism never recognized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the moral value of work.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> Useful labor had no place among
the requirements of the monastic ideal. Here doubtless is to
be sought one cause of that lamentable moral degeneracy
into which the monastic communities soon fell in almost all
the lands whither Buddhism was carried by the missionary
zeal of its early converts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Practical effects of the animal ethics of Buddhism</div>

<p>We have seen that under the Buddhist system the whole
animal and insect world is brought within the domain of
ethics. Buddhist morality has gone to a greater extreme
here than any other ethical system, excepting that of Jainism.
The inculcating of this sympathy with all living creatures has
developed one of the most attractive traits of the Hindu
character.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> But the extreme emphasis laid upon this branch
of ethics by Buddhism, Jainism, and modern Brahmanism or
Hinduism has had practical consequences of a very serious
nature. The scruple in regard to killing animals, even harmful
creatures, has cost India millions of human lives. It has
been a contributory cause of the country being overrun with
dangerous animals, such as tigers and venomous snakes, which
destroy many thousands of human beings annually, and has
even fostered the propagation of forms of life which are now
known to be effective agents in the spread of infectious diseases
like the bubonic plague.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> Nothing is surer than that
at this point the ethics of Buddhism must sooner or later feel
the modifying influence of Western science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Buddhist spirit of toleration</div>

<p>As an efficient force in promoting a spirit of the broadest
toleration, Buddhism holds a unique place among the great
religious and ethical systems of the world.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> An edict of the
Buddhist Emperor Asoka, dating from the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
inculcates the practice of toleration in these words: “A man
must not do reverence to his own sect by disparaging that
of another man for trivial reasons. Depreciation should be
for adequate reasons only, because the sects of other people
deserve reverence for one reason or another.”</p>

<p>The spirit of this imperial edict has been obeyed wherever
the word of the Buddha has prevailed. “There is no record
known to me,” writes Rhys Davids, “in the whole long
history of Buddhism, throughout the many centuries where
its followers have been for such lengthened periods supreme,
of any persecution by the Buddhists of the followers of any
other faith.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disesteem of the military life</div>

<p>Like Confucianism, Buddhism in its spirit and its ethical
teachings is, as we have seen, absolutely opposed to the spirit
of militarism in every form. Doubtless it has been a potent
force in fostering among the peoples of eastern Asia an anti-military
spirit and in creating a disesteem for the warlike
qualities of character.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> From one land—the Tartar land of
Thibet—it has banished absolutely the war spirit and practically
war itself.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> “It has taken all the fierceness out of the
Mongols,” and thus rendered useless the Great Wall built to
check their raids into China.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Softening effects on national character of Buddhist teachings</div>

<p>Buddhism has been well characterized as the incarnation
of sympathy with suffering. Inculcating a morality of gentleness,
instilling tenderness toward every living thing, it has
exercised a softening influence upon the spirit and temper of
every race that has received its teachings. We have in the
preceding chapter noted its humanizing effects upon Japanese
morality.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> Even in India, where after a comparatively short
period of supremacy it yielded sway again to Brahmanism, it
left significant traces of its brief dominance in the deepened
humanitarianism of the restored creed of the Brahmans, and
in certain of those traits and dispositions of the native races
which render truthfully descriptive the term “gentle Hindu.”
“The land of meekness and gentleness,” were the words
used by a native Hindu<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> at a recent Lake Mohonk Conference
to express the ethical character of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical significance of the ethical unity created by Buddhism</div>

<p>There is deep significance for the moral evolution of the
human race in this ethical propaganda of Buddhism. For
just as Christianity has created an ethical unity among the
nations of the Western world, so has Buddhism created a
certain ethical unity among the races of the Eastern world.
The historical importance of this lies in the fact that these
two ethical systems, though differing in form and content,
are in spirit essentially the same: both are moralities of universalism;
both teach the brotherhood of man; both exalt the
gentle<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> and self-denying virtues; both enjoin self-conquest;
both inculcate the duty of universal benevolence.</p>

<p>Because of this moral kinship, the ethical conquests of
Buddhism—and there is not a land in the Far East that has
not felt its influence—are in a degree supplemental to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
of Christianity in the West, and are thus an important step
in the creation of the ethical unity of the world. India and
Japan are both nearer to us ethically to-day than they would
be, were it not for the modifying influence of Buddhist teachings
upon the ethical spirit and temper of their peoples.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<span class="subhead">THE ETHICS OF ZOROASTRIANISM: AN IDEAL
OF COMBAT</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_123a">I. <span class="smcap">Philosophical and Religious Ideas which created
the Ethical Type</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Religious dualism</div>

<p>In view of the mixed good and evil in the world, thinkers
of antiquity, outside of Israel and before the rise of the Stoic
philosophy in Greece, could not conceive the universe as
being set in motion and directed by one God infinite at once
in power and goodness. Even the most penetrating intellect
of Greece faltered in his search for unity: “We cannot suppose,”
says Plato, “that the universe is ordered by one soul;
there must be more than one, probably not less than two—one
the author of good, and the other of evil.”<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> The seers
of Israel alone reached with perfect conviction the height of
the great argument, and announced confidently that He who
is the author of the good in the world is the author likewise
of the evil: “I form the light and create the darkness; I
make peace and create evil,” are the words which the prophet
Isaiah puts in the mouth of Yahweh.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<p>The religious thinkers of Persia never reached this lofty
viewpoint. It seemed to them, as it seemed to the Greek
philosopher, that at least two deities must have been concerned
in the creation and ordering of the universe. They
believed in the existence of two great powers: a good being,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
Ahura Mazda, the creator of light and of all beneficent things;
and an evil being, Ahriman, the author of darkness and of
all baneful creatures. Between these two powers they conceived
to be going on a fierce struggle for the mastery, in
which ultimate victory was assured to the good Ahura.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></p>

<p>This Persian world philosophy reacted favorably upon the
moral character, and, as we shall see further on, contributed
to create in ancient Persia a deep consciousness of the eternal
distinction between good and evil, a profound sentiment of
duty, and an active, strenuous morality.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> It is when contrasted
with the world philosophy of Brahmanism and Buddhism
that the ethical value of this dualistic philosophy of the old
Persian thinkers is best disclosed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conception of the character of the supreme god, Ahura Mazda</div>

<p>While it is true that the moral qualities attributed by a people
to their gods are nothing more nor less than the moral
qualities possessed or revered by this people themselves, still
it is also true that the moral nature thus given to the gods
reacts powerfully upon the ethical life of their worshipers and
tends to mold their moral character after the heavenly type.
In a word, celestial morality is at once effect and cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>In the case of no other people of antiquity, except the
people of Israel, did the conception of deity exercise a greater
influence upon morality than in that of the ancient Persians.
The supreme being, Ahura Mazda, was conceived, as we have
already noted, as the creator of the light and of all good things,
as the god of righteous order and benevolence. He was the
lover of truth. Truth was the innermost essence of his being,
as love is the innermost essence of the God of Christianity.
Farther on we shall see how this conception of deity
formed the mold in which was cast the Persian ideal of
moral excellence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethical character of Mithra</div>

<p>Ahura Mazda was the god of the sky. As time passed,
Mithra, the god of the sun, gradually came into greater
prominence and finally quite eclipsed the at first supreme
deity, Ahura. As the solar god he appropriated the ethical
attributes of the sky god and became preëeminently the god
of light, the champion of truth, and the avenger of lies. He
it is who, when not deceived, establisheth nations in victory
and strength.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<p>It was from this solar deity that Zoroastrianism in the later
pre-Christian centuries was called Mithraism, under which
name, as we shall see, it entered the Greco-Roman world and
there became a chief competitor with Christianity for the control
and guidance of the moral life of the European nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrine of the sacredness of the elements&#8203;— &#8203;fire, earth, and water</div>

<p>The principle of Persian world philosophy which, next after
that of the divided government of the universe, had probably
the greatest consequences, and those not wholly favorable, for
Persian morality, was the principle of the purity and sacredness
of the elements—fire, earth, and water. From this
principle or belief were deduced endless ritual requirements
whose aim was to preserve these elements from pollution, or
to restore their purity after defilement, and thus one large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
division of the moral code embraced mainly artificial duties,
duties which had no vital relation to natural morality, that
is, to conduct deriving its sanction from the natural feelings
of moral right and wrong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The personality of a great reformer, Zarathustra</div>

<p>As the great moral systems of Confucianism, Buddhism,
Christianity, and Mohammedanism bear each the impress of
the moral consciousness of some great teacher, so is it with
Zoroastrianism. For the moral ideal of Persia, while doubtless
largely the creation of the ethical feelings and convictions
of the Iranian race, developed through many centuries of race
experiences, nevertheless bears the unmistakable imprint of a
unique personality. That the Zarathustra of tradition represents
a real historical personage, there can hardly be longer a
reasonable doubt.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></p>

<p>The time of Zarathustra’s mission probably falls in the first
half of the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He thus belongs to that era in
the history of antiquity when, at various centers of culture,
reform movements announced the opening of a new epoch
in the moral evolution of the human race.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> The sum of what
we may believe to have been his moral teachings was that
man’s full duty is purity and sincerity in thought, word, and
deed, and an untiring warfare against evil.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_126">II. <span class="smcap">The Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The essence of the moral life</div>

<p>The distinctive character of the Persian moral ideal was
determined by the Persian dualistic world philosophy. The
essence of the moral life is a struggle against evil. The good
man is the strong fighter with Ahura against Ahriman and
all his creations. There was no place in the ideal for those
ascetic virtues—celibacy, fasting, self-mortification—which
conferred sainthood in India.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>The married state was regarded as superior to the unmarried:
“He who has children,” says the Zend-Avesta,
“is far above the childless man.”<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> Fasting was condemned
as ungodly, for “no one who does not eat has strength to do
heavy work of holiness”;<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> the well-fed man can fight better
than the one who lessens his vitality by fasting, can withstand
the cold better, “can strive against the wicked tyrant
and smite him on the head.”<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> The Zoroastrians regarded
Christianity, in the form in which they knew it, with disapproval,
because it exalted celibacy and made fasting a virtue.</p>

<p>This moral ideal which made life a strenuous battling for
the right was, after the ideal of the Hebrew prophets, the
loftiest developed by the ancient world. As we shall see
immediately, it tended to make the morality of the ancient
Persians “a morality of vigor and manliness.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Truthfulness the paramount virtue</div>

<p>Among the special virtues making up the moral ideal, the
highest place was assigned the virtue of veracity. It is noteworthy
how this virtue was, if not created, at least fostered by
the Persian conception of the supreme god, Ahura Mazda,
whose symbol was the light.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> As Ahriman was the god of
deceit and lies, so was Ahura the god of sincerity and truth.
This thought of deity made truthfulness a supreme virtue, for
man must in all things take for his model the good spirit
on whose side he battles.</p>

<p>Various testimonies bear witness to the high place assigned
in the scale of virtues to veracity. There was to be no liar
among those persons whom the Persian Noah (Yima) was
commanded to bring into the great underground abode, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the earth might be repeopled with a superior race after the
deadly cold of the long winter.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> The punishment provided
in the Zend-Avesta for false swearing was terrible. The very
first time one knowingly tells a lie unto Mithra (the god
adjured in taking an oath), “without waiting until it is done
again,” he shall be beaten on earth with twice seven hundred
stripes, and below in hell shall receive punishment harder
than the pain from the cutting off of limbs, from falling
down a precipice, from impalement.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>What is especially noteworthy here is that Zoroastrian
morals recognize the universality of the law of truthfulness
and require that contracts made even with the unfaithful be
faithfully kept: “Break not the contract,” says the sacred
law; ... “for Mithra stands for both the faithful and the
unfaithful.”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> Even more sacred than the engagements of
kinsman with kinsman are the engagements between nations,
for while a contract between members of the same group is
thirtyfold more binding than one between two strangers, a
contract between two nations is a thousandfold more binding.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a>
Here is raised a standard of international morality to which
modern statesmen and diplomatists have not yet attained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duty of industry; the ethics of labor</div>

<p>Industry was another cardinal virtue of the Zoroastrian
ideal of character. Labor was enjoined not only as honorable
but as a sacred duty. Wedgwood endeavors to show how this
virtue was the outgrowth of the Persian conception of the
origin of the universe. In Indian thought the world is not a
creation, the work of a divine Creator; it is an emanation
from an impersonal, unconscious, primal principle. But in
the Persian world-view the universe is conceived as the work
of a deity who labors to give it form and shape. This conception
of God as a worker reacted powerfully upon the ideal
of human excellence. Man must imitate this divine virtue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
labor. He must become a co-worker with the good Ahura
Mazda. Thus was labor idealized, and all work, even the
most lowly, made a sacred thing.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<p>There is in this view doubtless an element of truth, but
it is probable that this duty of industry and thrift upon which
such emphasis is laid in the Zend-Avesta was in the beginning
taught and enforced by the limited area of fruitful soil
and the necessity of careful irrigation and tillage, and that
only later the virtue thus engendered received the sanction
and support of religion. We may infer this from the fact that
agriculture was the most sacred of occupations. “He who
sows corn,” says the Zend-Avesta, “sows righteousness.”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a>
To sow corn, grass, and fruit; to water dry ground and to
drain ground that is too wet—this is the duty of man.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Animal ethics</div>

<p>The Zoroastrian code, like the <i>Laws of Manu</i>, gives a large
place to man’s duties toward the lower animal creation. But
the animal ethics of the Iranian lawgiver are much more reasonable
than those of the Hindu legislator. The Buddhist,
as we have seen, is enjoined to spare every living thing;
there is no distinction made between useful animals and dangerous
beasts and noxious reptiles. To such an extreme is
this regard for all life carried that agriculture, though a permissible
because a necessary occupation, still is looked upon
with disfavor for the reason that the plow injures the beings
living in the earth.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the Zoroastrian code distinguishes between
beneficent and baneful creatures, declares the first to
have been created by the good Ahura and the latter by the
evil Ahriman, and makes it the duty of the good man to protect
and treat kindly all useful animals, and to destroy all baneful
creatures, including noxious plants, such as weeds and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
brambles. Hence tilling the soil is praised as an especially
holy occupation, since the plow destroys the thistles and weeds
sown by the evil-disposed Ahriman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duty of protecting the purity of the elements</div>

<p>Another important department of Persian ethics was based
on the idea of the holiness of the elements—fire, earth, and
water. Any defilement of these was a sin, in some cases an
unpardonable sin. For instance, burying the corpse of a man
or of an animal in the earth, and not disinterring it within two
years—“for that deed there is nothing that can pay; ...
it is a trespass for which there is no atonement for ever and
ever.”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> Equally stringent were the prohibitions against the
pollution of the holy elements fire and water, through casting
into them any unclean matter.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></p>

<p>We shall perhaps best understand the moral value of such
duties as we have to do with in this division of Persian ethics,
if we compare them with those duties of the Christian code—Sabbath
observances—which are based on the idea of the
holiness of a certain portion of time. The ethical feelings
evoked in the one case are akin to those evoked in the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The judgment of the dead; the soul the judge of the soul</div>

<p>In the Persian judgment of the soul after death we have
the most profound and spiritual conception of the rewards
and punishments of the hereafter that has found expression
in the ethical teachings of any people. The soul is conceived
as being judged by itself. Upon its departure from this life
the soul of the faithful is met by a beautiful maiden, “fair as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the fairest thing,” who says to him: “I am thy own conscience;
I was lovely and thou madest me still lovelier; I was
fair and thou madest me still fairer, through thy good thought,
thy good speech, and thy good deed.” And then the soul is led
into the paradise of endless light. But the soul of the wicked
one is met by a hideous old woman, “uglier than the ugliest
thing,” who is his own conscience. She says to him: “I am
thy bad actions, O youth of evil thoughts, of evil words, of
evil deeds, of evil religion. It is on account of thy will and
actions that I am hideous and vile.” And then the soul is led
down into the hell of endless darkness.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>The remarkable thing about all this is that this profound
and spiritual conception of “a mental heaven and hell with
which we are now familiar as the only future state recognized
by intelligent people” should have found expression at the
early period when the faith of the Zend-Avesta was formulated.
“While mankind were delivered up to the childish
terrors of a future replete with horrors visited upon them
from without, the early Iranian sage announced the eternal
truth that the rewards of Heaven and the punishments of
Hell can only be from within. He gave us, we may fairly
say, through the systems which he has influenced, that great
doctrine of subjective recompense, which must work an essential
change in the mental habits of every one who receives it.”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_131">III. <span class="smcap">The Practice</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of the moral ideal upon the Persian character</div>

<p>In setting for man as his chief moral task a courageous
warfare against evil, the Zoroastrian ethics produced a certain
exaltation of character, and inspired strenuous activity
motived by a deep sense of duty. It created, or concurred
with other causes in creating, “a race of zealous Puritans,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
a strong, self-reliant people, who disdained all asceticism and
indolence.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> Fasting, as we have seen, was regarded as a crime
because it weakens the body and unfits one for active exertion.</p>

<p>It is instructive to place the masculine ideal of Persia
alongside the feminine ideal of Buddhist India and note the
different effects of these strongly contrasted standards of
goodness upon the races accepting them as the measure and
rule of rational conduct and duty. The Buddhist ideal, as we
have seen, is made up largely of the gentler, contemplative,
passive virtues, the virtues of the recluse and the ascetic. Its
issue in character is quietism. In opposition to this, the Zoroastrian
ideal inspires sturdy, virile, active virtues, the moral
qualities of the reformer, of the toiler and the fighter. The
natural effect of the ideal was to confirm in the Persians all the
seemingly original strong ethical qualities of the Iranic race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persian veneration for the truth</div>

<p>We have seen that one of the chief requirements of the
Zoroastrian code was truthfulness; man must be veracious
even as Ahura Mazda is veracious. Various testimonies assure
us that in respect to this virtue there was in ancient Persia a
commendable conformity of practice to theory. The feeling
for the beauty and nobility of truthfulness was much more
fully developed among the Persians than among any other
people of ancient or modern times. They were a truth-revering
and a truth-speaking people. Lying was the great
crime. To lie, to deceive, was to be a follower of Ahriman,
the god of lies and deceit. Hence lying was regarded as a
species of treason against Ahura Mazda. “The most disgraceful
thing in the world,” affirms Herodotus, in his account
of the Persians, “they think, is to tell a lie; the next worse
is to owe a debt, because, among other reasons, the debtor is
obliged to tell lies.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> In his report of the Persian system of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
education he says, “The boys are taught to ride, to draw the
bow, and to speak the truth.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> I was not wicked, nor a liar,
is the substance and purport of many a record of the ancient
kings. Rawlinson adduces this as evidence of their veneration
for truthfulness. “The special estimation in which truth
was held among the Persians,” he says, “is evidenced in a
remarkable manner by the inscriptions of Darius, where <em>lying</em>
is taken as the representative of all evil. It is the great calamity
of the usurpation of the pseudo-Smerdis, that ‘then the
<em>lie</em> became abounding in the land.’ ‘The Evil One (?) invented
<em>lies</em> that they should deceive the state.’ Darius is
favored by Ormazd, ‘because he was not a heretic, nor a
<em>liar</em>, nor a tyrant.’ His successors are exhorted not to cherish,
but to cast into utter perdition, ‘the man who may be a <em>liar</em>,
or who may be an evildoer.’ His great fear is lest it may be
thought that any part of the record which he has set up has
been ‘<em>falsely</em> related,’ and he even abstains from relating
certain events of his reign ‘lest to him who may hereafter
peruse the tablet, the many deeds that have been done by
him may seem to be ‘<em>falsely</em> recorded.’”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<p>The Persian kings, shaming in this all other nations ancient
and modern, kept sacredly their pledged word;<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> only once
were they ever even charged with having broken a treaty
with a foreign power.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p>That truthfulness was a national virtue of the Persians is
further attested by the fact that Herodotus represents them
as always relying implicitly upon every tale told them by
the lying Greeks whom they had taken captive. It never
seemed to occur to them that even an enemy could be guilty
of so awful a blasphemy as lying. It was this trait which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
led to their undoing at Salamis by the unscrupulous and
mendacious Themistocles.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the ideal upon Persian history</div>

<p>That exaltation of character which we have remarked as
springing naturally from the moral dignity with which man
was invested by being made an associate of the good Ahura
in his struggle with the wicked Ahriman may be noticed
especially in the aims and undertakings of the Persian monarchs
in the period before the moral decadence of the Iranian
civilization set in, and while the strength of the ethical
appeal of the Zoroastrian ideal was yet unimpaired. This
appears in all their records, which make the aim of their
conquests to be the overthrow of the powers of evil and disorder
and the setting up of a kingdom of righteousness in
the world. The inscriptions of Darius I read like the letters
of the Puritan Cromwell. Indeed, just as it was the masculine
moral ideal of English Puritanism which helped to make
England great, and strong to play her part in the transactions
of modern times, so we may believe it was the strenuous
moral ideal of Zoroastrianism that helped to make Persia
great, and strong to play her great rôle in the affairs of the
ancient world. In truth, the ideal is still an unexpended force
in history. It seems to have given immortality to the people
that it inspired; for it can hardly be doubted that it is largely
owing to their active practical morality that the Parsees in
India, the representatives to-day of the old Zoroastrian faith,
constitute such a dominant element in the Indian communities
of which they form a part.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<span class="subhead">THE MORAL EVOLUTION IN ISRAEL: AN IDEAL
OF OBEDIENCE TO A REVEALED LAW</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_135a">I. <span class="smcap">The Religious Basis of Hebrew Morality</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Introductory: Israel’s historic task a moral one</div>

<p>To the pious Hebrew the rainbow, which to the esthetic
Greek was merely the beautiful pathway of Iris, the messenger
of Olympus, was Yahweh’s bow hung out from the dark
retreating thundercloud as a sign of righteous anger spent
and the pledge of a divine covenant and promise. In this
ethical interpretation by the Hebrew spirit of this portent is
foretokened the history and mission of ancient Israel. It was
her allotted task to interpret in ethical terms the phenomena
of the world of nature and the drama of human life and
history. And it was her happy lot to become the teacher to
mankind of the truth of an alone and righteous God, and to
be the creator of a moral ideal which is to-day the highest
ethical standard of all the races of the Western world, and
the most vital moral force at work in universal history.</p>

<p>In the short account which we shall give of Hebrew morality
we shall adopt a mode of treatment somewhat different
from that followed in describing the moral systems of the
peoples already passed in review, for the reason that in the
case of the ancient Hebrews the historical material is sufficiently
abundant to enable us to trace step by step the
development of the ethical ideal and to watch the gradual
clarification of the moral consciousness of the race.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> Hence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
after speaking of the religious ideas which formed the basis
of the moral code, we shall sketch briefly the evolution of the
rudimentary morality of the tribal age of the nation into the
high ideal of the prophets of the later time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conception of deity; monolatry and monotheism</div>

<p>We have seen how the Persian view of deity molded Persian
morality. In a still more decisive way did the Hebrew
idea of God, of his character and his relation to Israel and
the world, shape and mold the moral ideal of the race.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p>When the Hebrews in the second millennium before
Christ appeared in history, they were in possession of a
stock of ideas concerning the gods which was, in all essentials
save one, altogether like that held by their Semitic
kinsmen of the various lands of southwestern Asia. The
single essential point of difference between their religious
belief and that of their neighbors was this: the nations about
them were polytheists; they were monolatrists; that is, the
Hebrews, while they believed in many gods, worshiped only
one god, their tribal god Yahweh. As Stade expresses it,
“the old Israelite was a theoretical polytheist, but a practical
monotheist.”<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></p>

<p>There is scarcely need that we add in qualification of this,
that when the Hebrews first appeared in history they were
not all monolatrists. The multitude were then, and for a long
time thereafter, polytheists. All that can be affirmed is that in
the earliest times of their history there were among them teachers
of monolatrism, teachers who inculcated the duty of worshiping
a single god, the patron and champion of the nation.</p>

<p>Through what experiences and under what tuition these
teachers of Israel made the passage in thought from polytheism
to monolatrism we need not now inquire. For our purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
we need simply note the fact and emphasize its supreme historical
importance. It marks the beginning of a divergent
evolution in religious belief and ethical conviction which in
the lapse of time was to lead Israel far apart from her Semitic
kinsmen, and make her the standard bearer of a universal
religion and a universal morality. For monolatry was with
the prophets and seers of Israel only the first step toward
monotheism, the doctrine that there is only one God, the
Universal Father. This idea of deity was not reached much
before the time of the Second Isaiah. Along with this later
view of Yahweh there came the thought and conviction that
he is a God of absolute righteousness. This conception of
God and of his character was, as we shall see, an idea charged
with the deepest significance not only for the ethical development
in Israel but for the moral life of all mankind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The belief in a supernaturally revealed law</div>

<p>After this conception of Yahweh, first as a jealous tribal
deity and later as the sole God and Universal Father, the
belief in a supernaturally revealed law wherein all the duties
of man were made known was the most potent force in
molding the moral ideal of Israel. It was this belief which
made the chief duty of man to be unquestioning obedience
to the divine commandments; for the revealed law was the
measure of duty—what it enjoined was right, what it forbade
was wrong.</p>

<p>This investiture of an outer law, conceived to be of supernatural
origin, with sovereign authority over man’s every act,
and the subordination to it of the inner law of the individual
conscience, had consequences of vast importance for the ethical
evolution not only in ancient Israel but also among all
the peoples whose moral ideal was essentially an inheritance
from her. For where the full duty of man is made to consist
in obedience to the minute requirements of an external law
there is inevitably created a morality made up largely of
artificial ritual duties, and as intelligence grows and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
moral consciousness deepens and clarifies, there necessarily
arises a conflict between this conventional morality and the
natural morality of the human reason and conscience. In
such a conflict, in this way created, within the moral life of
Israel centers the dramatic interest of her moral history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Special ground of the Israelites’ feeling that obedience to the law was their highest duty</div>

<p>There was a special reason why the Israelites felt that
their first duty was absolute obedience to the revealed will
of Yahweh. They possessed a tradition which told how
their fathers were serfs in the land of Egypt; how Yahweh,
through his servant Moses, had intervened in their behalf,
and with a strong arm and with mighty signs had brought
them up out of the land of bondage; and how at Mt. Sinai he
had entered into a covenant with them in which he pledged
to them his powerful protection on condition of their fidelity
in his worship and obedience to all his commandments.</p>

<p>This belief was the germ out of which grew most of what
was unique in the ethical development of Israel.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> It played
exactly the same part in creating and molding the religious
conscience of Israel that the Christian’s belief in the descent
of the Son of God into the world and his voluntary death to
effect man’s deliverance has had in molding the religious conscience
of Christendom. As we advance in our study we shall
see how largely the moral consciousness of the Israelites was
a creation of this belief in a most sacred covenant between
Yahweh and their fathers at the “Terrible Mount” in the
wilderness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rite of sacrifice</div>

<p>We have seen that religion on the lower levels of culture
consists largely in sacrifice; that is, in gifts or offerings either
to the spirits of the dead or to the gods. The religion of
the ancient Hebrews did not differ in this respect from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
religion of other peoples in the same stage of culture.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> But
the evolution of the rite of sacrifice among the Israelites differs
from its development among all other peoples in that, under
the influence of the Hebrew spirit, the rite was gradually
reduced to symbolism and spiritualized. In this process it
underwent the most remarkable metamorphoses. Beginning
with meat and drink offerings from man to God, it ends with
God giving himself a sacrifice for man. The system thus
transformed became the great inspirer of ethical sentiment
and a unique vehicle of moral instruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The vagueness of the belief in an after life</div>

<p>The Israelite’s thought of death and of the after life also
reacted powerfully upon his moral feelings and colored all his
ethical speculations; for, like the conceptions held of God,
the notions entertained of man’s lot after death, as we have
seen in the case of the ancient Egyptians, has far-reaching
consequences for the moral life.</p>

<p>Now the Hebrew conception of the future state was the
same as the Babylonian. Sheol, like the Babylonian Arallu,
was a vague and shadowy region beneath the earth, a sad and
dismal place which received without distinction the good and
the bad. The same fate was allotted all who went down to
the grave: “The small and the great are there; and the
servant is free from his master.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> There was no return there
for good, or for evil: “But the dead know not anything, neither
have they any more a reward.”<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> Memory and hope
were there dead: “For in death there is no remembrance of
thee.... They that go down into the pit cannot hope for
thy truth.”<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>We shall see later how this vague and feebly held idea of
the future life reacted upon the evolution of the moral consciousness
in Israel, how deeply it influenced the troubled
ethical speculations of the more thoughtful minds of the
nation, and how it inspired theories of the moral order of the
world which have not yet lost their power over the thoughts
and the conduct of men.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> We need in this place merely to
point out how it was the absence of a clearly defined belief in
a life of rewards and punishments in another world that created,
or helped to create, the Messianic ideal, one of the most
fruitful conceptions, in its ethical outcomes, that ever entered
into the mind of man.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_140">II. <span class="smcap">The Evolution of the Moral Ideal</span></h3>

<h4 id="toclink_140a"><i>1. The Development up to the Exile</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">The primitive moral code</div>

<p>The history of Hebrew morals is the record of a long and
slow evolution. The primitive code with which the development
began was the code of Semitic nomadism. It was essentially
the same as that which to-day governs the conduct of
the practically unchanged kinsmen of the Hebrews, the Bedouin
of Arabia and neighboring lands. It was the morality
of the kinship group.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> The principle of communal responsibility,
which affords the key to a large part of the moral history
of Israel, had not yet been challenged as unethical, and
blood revenge was a most sacred duty. The circle covered by
the moral feelings was still narrow; there was practically no sentiment
of duty or obligation toward tribes or nations outside the
group of tribes constituting the people of Israel. The conception
of Yahweh as a jealous national god prevented the growth
of feelings which might have formed the basis of a true international
morality. The wars which the Israelites waged against
their enemies were wars of ruthless slaughter and rapine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>This rudimentary morality is summarized in the Decalogue,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a>
for the Ten Commandments are indisputably of a high antiquity.
One mark of the primitive character of this legislation
is the negative form of the commandments.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> Where
there is need of the “thou shalt not,” the moral life is still
on a low plane. The aim and purpose of the law thus
worded are restraint and repression. There is a wide interval
in moral chronology between the morality of the Ten Words
and that of the Sermon on the Mount. In this earlier code
there is only the slightest recognition of the truth that the
truly moral life consists not in refraining from evil but in
doing good. The nomads of the desert for whom these
negative commands were framed, forbidding mostly crude,
coarse crimes, were evidently a long way yet from that level
of moral attainment where the only law is the law of love
and liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral anarchy of the age of the Judges</div>

<p>That period of transition which marks the passage of the
Israelite tribes from the nomadic pastoral life of the desert to
a settled agricultural life in Palestine may be instructively
compared with that transition period in the history of Europe
which followed the migration of the German tribes and their
settlement in the provinces of the disrupted Roman Empire.
It was an epoch characterized by the rapid decay of the clan
and tribal organization, with an accompanying loss of the
rude virtues of the nomadic and pastoral life, and the acquisition
of the vices of the civilized or semicivilized communities
among which they had thrust themselves and whose lands
they had forcibly seized.</p>

<p>Especially upon the religious system, which in Israel was
ever closely bound up with morality, was felt the reaction of
the new environment. Many foreign elements adopted from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
the Canaanite peoples were incorporated with it, while the
national god Yahweh, as conceived by the popular imagination,
tended to become sanguinary, capricious, and unjust.
He became eminently a god of war, and is for his people
right or wrong. Thus a chief bulwark of morality was impaired.
The result was a moral interregnum. The old standards
and rules of conduct lost their sanction. Every man
did that which was right in his own eyes.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Prophetism: its different elements</div>

<p>The necessities of the situation called into existence the
monarchy (about 1050 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Then followed the disruption
of the kingdom (about 953 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). The significant matter in
the moral domain during the period of the united and the
divided kingdom<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> was the appearance of teachers called
prophets or seers, men who were believed to speak the word
given them by Yahweh. This emergence of prophetism in
Israel is beyond controversy one of the most important phenomena
in the moral history of the world.</p>

<p>There were in this prophetism various elements.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> First, it
contained a nomadic element; that is, some of the prophets
were men who looked backward to the simple pastoral life of
the desert as the ideal moral life. They regarded civilization
as the sum of all evils. Their reading of history was, in the
words of Wellhausen, that “as the human race goes forward
in civilization, it goes backward in the fear of God.” Second,
there was in it a socialistic element. These prophets were the
first socialists. Theirs was the first passionate plea for the poor,
the wretched, and the heavy-burdened. Third, it contained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
a predictive element. The prophets were regarded as seers,
as foretellers of future events. Fourth, there was in this
prophetism an element of pure intuitional morality which
was in irreconcilable antagonism to all legal ritual morality.
Fifth, it contained a monotheistic element. The later prophets
were distinctively teachers of the doctrine that there is only
one God, beside whom there is no other.</p>

<p>Of these several elements the predictive, or prophetic in
the popular sense, has been given such undue prominence
that Hebrew prophetism in the minds of many stands for little
else than a supernatural forecasting of future events. But,
in truth, this is the element of least importance. In the words
of Kuenen, the business of the prophets was “not to communicate
what shall happen, but to insist upon what <em>ought</em> to
happen.”<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> They were preachers of individual and social
righteousness. It is this ethical element, forming the very
heart and core of their message, which makes the appearance
of prophetism in Israel a matter of such transcendent importance
for universal history. Our main task in the following
pages of this chapter will be to point out this moral element
in the message of the prophets, to show how the conception
of Yahweh was by them moralized, and how the morality they
inculcated became purer and more elevated as the centuries
passed, till the evolution culminated in the lofty teachings of
the Prophet of Nazareth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The beginnings of historical prophetism: Elijah and Elisha</div>

<p>The real history of Hebrew prophetism opens with the
appearance in the northern kingdom, about the beginning of
the ninth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, of the great prophets Elijah and Elisha.
It was the moral degeneracy of the times of the monarchy,
the inrush of the hateful vices of civilization,—the greed of
land<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> and of wealth, the cruel inequalities of the new society,
the selfish luxury of the rich, the harsh oppression of the poor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
the forgetting of men’s kinship, the substitution of the worship
of other gods for the sole worship of Yahweh,—it was
all this which called out the vehement protest of these teachers
of social justice and national righteousness.</p>

<p>It was, however, a very different prophetism from that of
the later seers of Israel which was represented by these early
teachers. There was in it a large nomadic element. Its representatives
looked back to the times of the simple pastoral
life of the fathers as the Golden Age of Israel. They hated
civilization, that grossly material civilization which Israel,
under the lead of an idolatrous and luxurious court, was now
adopting from the surrounding nations, and looked upon it as
“the sum of all evils.” They were, furthermore, monolatrists
rather than monotheists. They believed in sacrifice; but sacrifices
must not be offered to strange gods—only to Yahweh.
They were fanatical in their zeal for the worship of Israel’s
patron God; but even here there was an ethical element, for
in their view the triumph of the worship of Yahweh over that
of the Baals meant a triumph of the simple, severe, desert
morality over the voluptuousness and the nameless vices of
the Canaanite civilization.</p>

<p>This early prophetism, in a word, was a sort of Puritanism.
Renan calls it “this terrible prophetism.” It was fierce, cruel,
fanatical, intolerant, like English Puritanism. Indeed, it can
best be studied in this modern seventeenth-century prophetism,
which was essentially a revival of it. But notwithstanding
the imperfect character of this early prophetism, because
of the true ethical element it contained,<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> its appearance in
Israel and its successful fight against a sensuous idolatry was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
a matter of vast moral import, for here in this narrow, intolerant
monolatry is the real historical beginning of that long
religious-ethical development which lends chief significance to
the story of Israel, and constitutes a main interest of the history
of European civilization. In the words of Renan, “The
prophetism which struggled under Ahab and triumphed under
Jehu is ... upon the whole the most decisive event in the history
of Israel. It forms the commencement of the chain which,
after nine hundred years, found the last link in Jesus.”<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral advance represented by Amos (760 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and Hosea (738–735 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)</div>

<p>The second link in this chain was formed by the prophets
Amos and Hosea, who delivered their message about the
middle of the eighth century. Amos was the earlier. There
is in his message the note of true prophetism. His thought
of Yahweh is that he is a God who hates iniquity and loves
righteousness. What angers him is not idolatry or the worship
of other gods, but social wrongs and injustice—wickedness
in every form. He is angry with Israel<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> because there
has been stored up violence and robbery in the palace;<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> because
of the luxury and self-indulgence of the rich; because
of the treading upon the poor and the taking from him burdens
of wheat; because of the taking of bribes and the turning
aside of the poor in the gate from their right;<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> because
of the falsifying of the balances by deceit that the poor may
be bought for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> And
what pleases Yahweh is not fast days and sacrifices, but justice
and righteousness: “I hate, ... I despise your fast days,”<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>
declares Yahweh. “Though ye offer me burnt offerings and
meat offerings, I will not accept.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> “But let judgment run
down as water and righteousness as a mighty stream.”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>A generation later the prophet Hosea repeats the same
message; namely, that what angers Yahweh is moral evil—lying,
swearing, stealing, and killing. He puts in the mouth
of Yahweh these words: “For I desire mercy and not sacrifice,
and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.”<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></p>

<p>There is here a notable ethical advance over the word to
Israel of the prophets of the preceding century. The thought
of Amos and Hosea that it is social wrongdoing that angers
Yahweh is indeed no new thought, for we meet with this
conception of the moral character of God in the teachings of
the earlier prophets; what is new is the emphasis which is
laid upon it. Here we reach ethical monolatry;<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> ethical
monotheism lies not far in the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ideal of the brotherhood of nations and universal peace</div>

<p>The morality of Amos and Hosea infolded the germ of
ethical cosmopolitanism. The conviction that the government
of Yahweh is founded on absolute justice and righteousness
led to the conviction of its ultimate universality, “for right is
everywhere right, and wrong is everywhere wrong.” The
political situation in the Semitic world at this time fostered
the thought thus awakened. The predominant fact in international
relations in the latter half of the eighth century was
the growth of the Assyrian Empire. In its expansion it had
already engulfed many of the smaller states of western Asia,
and Assyria had become a world power. Political unity suggested
now, as it did when Rome had established a world
empire, religious and ethical unity. Yahweh, Israel’s God of
justice and right, is the suzerain of all other gods and peoples.
He will establish a world-wide kingdom, and all nations shall
acknowledge his righteous rule.</p>

<p>As representatives of this broadening vision we have the
great prophets Isaiah and Micah, who, proclaiming the universal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
reach of the law of right and justice, held aloft a noble ethical
ideal of the brotherhood of nations and universal peace.
Seers by virtue of their conviction of the absoluteness, the oneness
and sovereignty, of the moral law, they foretold the
coming of a time in the last days when all the nations of the
earth should form a federation under the suzerainty of Israel
with Jerusalem as the world capital: “Out of Zion shall go
forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, and
he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword
against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></p>

<p>This is the first distinct expression in Hebrew literature,
or in that of any race, of the idea of the brotherhood of man
and a federated world. The lofty ideal has never faded from
the eyes of men. It has inspired all the noblest visions of
world unity and peace through the war-troubled ages, and is
in the world of to-day the source and spring of much of that
ethical idealism which with prophetic faith and conviction
proclaims a federated world, with the nations dwelling together
in peace and amity, as the one divine event toward
which all history moves.</p>

<p>With this lofty ethical universalism in the teachings of
Isaiah and Micah was joined a simple personal and social
morality of the human heart and reason. These prophets
were at one with Amos and Hosea in proclaiming that what
Yahweh delights in is not sacrifices and the observance of
new moons and Sabbaths, but cleanliness of life and services
of love. Hear Isaiah as he repeats the words of the Lord:
“I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of
he goats.... Your new moons and your appointed feasts
my soul hateth.... Cease to do evil; learn to do well;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
plead for the widow.”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> And listen to Micah: “Wherewith
shall I come before the Lord and bow myself before the high
God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with
calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands
of rams and with ten thousands of rivers of oil?...
He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God?”<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The prophetic spirit creates a unique ethical literature</div>

<p>The prophets of the eighth century were the first of the
literary prophets; that is, the first of those who employed literature
as the vehicle of their message to Israel. Hence here
our attention is called to a matter of supreme significance for
universal morality—the ethicalizing of the mythology and
traditional history of the Hebrew people.</p>

<p>It was during the age of the kings that the mass of cosmological
myths and legends borrowed from Babylonia,—doubtless
largely through contact with Assyria,—the traditions
of the patriarchs, and the story of the sojourn in
Egypt and the Exodus, all of which had been transmitted
from the foretime orally or in writing, was worked over and
edited afresh, in which process it received the indelible stamp
of the deeper and truer moral consciousness of this later age.
For though probably little of this work was done by the
prophets themselves, it was done by men who wrote under
the inspiration of the new thoughts of God and of his moral
government which had been awakened in the souls of the
great teachers of Israel. The polytheistic elements of these
myths and traditions and their grosser and more archaic immoralities
were pruned away, while at the same time they
were given a monotheistic cast and a truer morality was
breathed into them. In a word, all this literary material was
censored by the growing moral consciousness of Israel. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
outcome was the creation of a literature absolutely unique in
its moral educative worth.</p>

<p>Thus the remolded and moralized Chaldean account of the
creation of the world and the beginnings of human history
came to form the basis of the opening chapters of Genesis,
whose influence upon Hebrew morality, through molding
Israel’s idea of the character of Yahweh and of his relations
to man, it would hardly be possible to exaggerate. Also the
tradition of the Exodus, given now its final form and received
by the later generations of Israel as an historically true account
of the experiences of their fathers, left an ineffaceable
impress upon the mind and heart of the Hebrew nation,
determining largely their ideas as to their chief moral obligations
as the chosen and covenanted people of Yahweh. It
was this tradition of their heroic past which was the inspiration
of the moral strivings of the nation. Furthermore,
all this literary material, thus reshaped and colored by the
growing monotheistic ideas of the teachers of Israel and bearing
the stamp of their gradually deepening moral consciousness,
and in this form transmitted to the Aryan nations of
the West, was destined to become one of the most important
factors not merely in the religious but especially in the moral
life of the European peoples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethicalizing of pagan festivals and cults</div>

<p>Just as the myths and traditions, in part borrowed from
neighboring peoples and in part transmitted from Israel’s
own foretime, were transformed and moralized by the ethical
genius of the Hebrew spirit, so were the institutions and
festivals borrowed by the Israelites from kindred Semitic
peoples, and particularly from the Canaanites, transmuted
and moralized.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> Permeated by the ethical spirit of Israel’s
great teachers and transformed into moral symbols, these
originally nonethical agricultural cults and festivals were
given a distinct educative value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>Among these pagan institutions thus moralized was the
festival or rest day of the Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> Filled with ethical
meaning and consecrated to a religious-moral purpose, this
originally pagan lunar festival was made a most important
means of moral instruction and discipline.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> This borrowing
and moralizing by Israel of this festival has an almost exact
parallel in the later borrowing and moralizing by the Christian
Church of the pagan festival of the winter solstice, which
has given Christendom one of its most beautiful anniversaries,
one which takes precedence of all others in its power
to evoke the tenderest altruistic sentiments.</p>

<p>As with the Sabbath, so was it with all the festivals which
the Israelites, after their settlement in Palestine and during
the period when they were passing from the nomadic to the
agricultural life, adopted from the Canaanite peoples among
whom they were dwelling. All of these in the course of time
were turned from their original purpose, were cleansed of
immoral and sensuous elements, and were thus made the
means of awakening moral feelings and developing moral
character.</p>

<p>This transforming power of the ethical genius of Israel
finds a true historical parallel in the esthetic genius of
ancient Hellas, which, receiving from every side elements
of art and general culture, inspired them all with the beauty
and energy of her own spirit.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> “Israel,” as Cornill finely
says, “resembles in spiritual things the fabulous King Midas,
who turned everything he touched into gold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The dual morality of the Deuteronomic code</div>

<p>The effect of the capture of Samaria by the Assyrians in
722 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and the carrying away into captivity of the flower of
the Ten Tribes was to put an end to prophetism in the North
and to make Judah in the South the center of the movement
which had such significance for the moral life of the world.</p>

<p>During the century and a half that passed between the fall
of the northern kingdom and the destruction of Jerusalem
by the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar, only one great
prophet appeared in Judah. This was Jeremiah, who prophesied
in the reign of King Josiah, just a little time before
the Captivity.</p>

<p>It was during the reign of this king that there appeared a
book which, excepting the Gospels of the New Testament,
has had a greater influence upon the general evolution of
morality than any other book ever written. This was a work
known as the Book of Deuteronomy, that is, the repetition of
the law. Before the discovery of the Laws of Hammurabi
this was the oldest known code of laws.</p>

<p>The book contains much archaic material—traditions, customs,
judicial decisions, laws, and rituals—manifestly handed
down from the earliest times in Israel, with additions made
at the moment of its appearance, and all bearing plainly the
stamp of the spirit and temper of these later times. Hence
it comes that there are two moralities embodied in the work—an
atavistic ritual morality and a progressive social morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ritual ethics of the code</div>

<p>In that part of the code which has to do with the ethics
of ritualism the dominant motive of the editors or compilers
springs from a dread and abhorrence of idolatry, like the dread
and abhorrence of heresy in medieval Christendom. Yahweh
will divide his worship with no other god. Israel had gone
after other gods and Yahweh had given her into the hands
of the Assyrians. A like fate awaited Judah if she served
any other than him: “Ye shall not go after other gods, or the
gods of the people which are round about you, lest the anger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
of the Lord be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from
off the face of the earth,”<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> is the first commandment with
threatening.</p>

<p>Fear that Yahweh would do unto Judah as he had done
unto Israel awakened the conscience of the nation. Idolatry
was suppressed; the high places on which incense was burned
unto the Baals were defiled, and the altars and the images of
the strange gods were broken down and ground into dust.</p>

<p>This reform movement practically ended the long struggle
which had gone on now for six hundred years and more
between polytheism and the rising monotheism of the people
of Israel. But unfortunately while the monotheistic element
of the religion of Yahweh was brought out by the reform in
sharper outline, the ethical element was obscured. The religion
that was now made the exclusive worship was really
little more than a pagan cult. It consisted in the careful
keeping of feast days and the observance of the rites and
sacrifices of the Temple—an inheritance largely from the
heathen nations around about Israel. Nothing could have
been more opposed to true prophetism. It was the triumph
of reactionary ritualism.</p>

<p>This victory of ritualism has exerted an almost incalculable
influence upon the development of morality from the time of
King Josiah down to the present day. The immediate effect
upon prophetism in Judah was most lamentable. “Deuteronomy
simply confirmed the belief that religion was concerned
with ritual rather than with morality.”<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> And so the outcome
of the promulgation of a written revealed law was, in the
words of Wellhausen, “the death of prophecy.”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>But this fatal effect was not felt at once. In the dark
days of the Exile, now just at hand, there was a revival of
true prophetism; but after the return from the Captivity, as
we shall see, the prophetic spirit was almost stifled by the
rigid legalism of the Temple cult. And it was this same
Deuteronomic law which, in the hands of medieval inquisitors,
stifled awakening prophetism in Europe and delayed
for generations true moral reform after the stirring of the
European mind by the Renaissance.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p>The intolerant spirit of this narrow, rigid religion of ritualism
found specially sinister expression in Israel’s war ethics.
Instead of promoting international amity and good will, it
deepened intertribal prejudices and hatreds and intensified
the barbarities of war. “Thou shalt save alive nothing that
breatheth;”<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> “thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy
them, thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show
mercy unto them,”<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> were the commands to Israel regarding
the nations round about her who were the worshipers of other
gods than Yahweh.</p>

<p>Thus religion was made an active principle of international
savagery. It made it, in the words of Cheyne, “difficult, if
not impossible, ... to love God fervently without hating a
large section of God’s creatures.”<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> Under the influence of
the fierce ordinances of the Deuteronomic code the war
practices of the Israelites became more ferocious and savage
than those of any other nation of antiquity, unless it be
those of the Assyrian kings. Their enemies, who were also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
the enemies of Yahweh, they smote with the utmost fury,
putting to the edge of the sword men, women, and the little
ones, and taking as booty the cattle and the spoils.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The social ethics of the code</div>

<p>But, as we have said, there were two spirits striving together
in this strange Deuteronomic code. In opposition to this
spirit of stern fanatical intolerance there was a spirit of tender
sympathy for the unfortunate, the poor, and the oppressed.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a>
Along with this priestly morality, based on a certain conception
of Yahweh and of his relations to Israel, there was
another wholly different morality—a social morality whose
chief sanctions were the natural impulses and sentiments of
the human heart and conscience.</p>

<p>This code of social ethics bears witness to a progressive
development of the moral consciousness in Israel. The
ethical advance is unmistakably registered in various ameliorations
effected in the crude customary law of earlier times.
One of the most noteworthy of these mitigations concerned
the primitive blood revenge. In common with other
peoples in the kinship stage of culture, the early Hebrews
in their pursuit of blood vengeance made no distinction
between intentional and unintentional homicide. The regulations
of the Deuteronomic code regarding the so-called
cities of refuge<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> bear witness to a growing power of moral
discrimination; for these cities are made inviolable sanctuaries
whither might flee the manslayer who had slain his
neighbor unawares and hated him not in time past.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>Especially is the humanitarian advance shown in the provisions
of the code which relate to the poor, the debtor, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
the bondsman. We meet here some of the most humane
regulations to be found in any of the codes of antiquity.
Social morality is almost made to consist in consideration for
the poor: “If there be among you a poor man ... thou shalt
open thine hand wide unto him”—so the law enjoins—“and
shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need.”<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> Things
that were necessities to the poor man were not to be taken
as security for a loan: “No man shall take the nether or
the upper millstone to pledge.”<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> If a garment be taken as
security, this must be returned before night, in order that the
man may sleep in his own raiment.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> The widow’s raiment
must not be taken in pledge at all.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> The wages of the poor
and needy must be promptly paid: “At his day thou shalt
give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for
he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it.”<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>The law goes even further in its humane endeavor to
prevent the oppression of the needy. The loaning of money
in ancient times was in general a very different thing from
similar money transactions in this commercial and industrial
age of ours. Those seeking loans were the very poor, who
were forced to borrow to meet domestic necessities. Under
such conditions the taking of interest would naturally be denounced,
and those who did so would come to be regarded
as extortioners, and robbers of the poor. Hence the prohibition,
“Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother;
... unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury.”<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p>This legislation, well adapted to the times and the conditions
of the society for which it was enacted, became centuries
later, through its adoption and attempted enforcement by the
medieval Church, a source of grave mischief. It constituted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
a heavy drag for centuries upon the industrial development
of European civilization.</p>

<p>The same spirit of tenderness toward the portionless and
needy is shown in the provision concerning the ingathering
of the harvest: “When thou cuttest down thine harvest in
thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt
not go again to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the
fatherless, and for the widow.”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> This tender consideration
for the poor speaks from one of the most beautiful of Bible
pictures—that of the Moabitess Ruth gleaning in the fields
after the reapers, who “let fall some of the handfuls of
purpose for her.”<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>The social conscience awakening in Israel, to which the
above regulations and commandments bear witness, finds
further expression in the provisions of the code effecting
ameliorations in the lot of the unfortunate bondsman. The
master is enjoined to see that the Sabbath is observed by his
slave as well as by himself and his family, and the reason
assigned is the humanitarian one—“that thy manservant
and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.”<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> And a
limitation was set to the time that a person could be held
in bondage: “And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an
Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years;
then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from
thee.”<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> Furthermore, the law is solicitous respecting the
welfare of the bondsman even after emancipation: “And
when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let
him go away empty. Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of
thy flock, and out of thy threshing floor, and out of thy
winepress: of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed
thee thou shalt give unto him.”<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<p>To these ameliorative measures effect is sought to be given
through a revival of memories of the past. The masters are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
enjoined to be compassionate to their bondsmen because they
themselves had been worn and bruised in bondage: “Remember,”
says the lawgiver, “that ye were bondsmen in the
land of Egypt.”<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></p>

<h4 id="toclink_157"><i>2. The Morality of the Prophets of the Exile</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">The effects of the Captivity upon the moral evolution in Israel</div>

<p>We have reached now a turning point in the moral history
of Israel. Speaking of the effects of the Exile upon the inner
life of Israel, Renan uses these words: “Twice it was the
fate of Israel to owe its salvation to that which is the ruin of
others, and to be recalled by the crushing of its earthly hopes
to a sense of its great duties toward humanity.”</p>

<p>The mission of Israel, her duty toward humanity, was, as
we have said, to interpret life in ethical terms. As the story
of the exilic and the postexilic period unfolds, we shall see
how the sad experiences of the Exile purified and deepened
the moral consciousness of Israel, and prepared her for the
great part she was destined to play in the moral education
of mankind.</p>

<p>It was the great unknown prophet of the Exile, the so-called
Second Isaiah, who wrote just after the capture of Babylon
by the Persian king Cyrus (539 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), who was the representative
of the essentially new conceptions of Yahweh and of
the requirements of the moral law which characterize this
ethical development.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethical monotheism at last; religion and morality at one</div>

<p>Shut out from participation in political affairs, the best
energies of the exiled community seem to have been turned
to the things of the inner life, and consequently the development
in the religious and moral spheres went on apace. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
conception of God—of what is pleasing to him and what
he requires of man—was elevated and purified.</p>

<p>We meet now for the first time monotheism pure and absolute.
Yahweh is conceived as the only God; the gods of
the other nations are no gods at all. Some of the earlier
prophets had, it is true, caught sight of this lofty truth; but
the multitude of the people certainly had no such idea of
their patron god. The prophets of the Exile are the first to
proclaim this doctrine with such emphasis as to cause it to
become a part of the indestructible religious consciousness
of Israel.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p>One cannot read the declarations which the unknown
prophet puts in the mouth of Yahweh—“Before me there
was no God formed, neither shall there be after me;”<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> “I
am the first and I am the last; and besides me there is no
God;”<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> “I am Yahweh who wrought everything, who stretched
forth the heavens above, who spread forth the earth—who
was with me;”<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> “I am Yahweh and there is none beside
me;”<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> “I am God, and there is none else, I am God, and
there is none like me”<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a>—one cannot read these declarations
without being convinced that they were not phrased by one
to whom the idea of the unity of God had become a commonplace,
but rather by one to whom the thought was something
in the nature of a discovery.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></p>

<p>But it was not merely the idea of the oneness of deity, of
Yahweh as the sole God, that was the element of supreme
significance in this practically new thought of God. There
is nothing unethical in the belief in many gods; nor, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
other hand, is there anything ethical in the belief that there
is only one God. The historically important thing about the
monotheism of Israel is that it was ethical monotheism. Up
to the time of the Exile the multitude in Israel, notwithstanding
the teachings of the prophets Amos and Hosea, Isaiah
and Micah, had never thought of Yahweh as an absolutely
just god, but rather as one who would favor his people under
all circumstances. Put in the language of to-day, they conceived
Yahweh as a partisan, who would be for his people
right or wrong. But under the discipline of the Exile the
more spiritual-minded of the nation came to accept the teaching
that Yahweh’s favor “is conditioned by a law of absolute
righteousness.”<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></p>

<p>This conception of God marks a turning point in the moral
evolution of humanity. It lifted a new ethical standard. It
effected a union of religion and morality. This, it is true, was
not a wholly new thing in history. In the worship of the good
Osiris in Egypt these elements had been united; in the
Zoroastrian worship of Ahura Mazda they had also been
brought together; and at this very time in Greece there was
an effort being made to unite them in the worship of the
Delphian Apollo. But the union effected by the prophets of
Israel was the only one destined to have large and permanent
historical consequences. Because of the ethical content given
the god idea by them, their conception of deity constituted
the most precious part of the spiritual heritage bequeathed
by Judaism to Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Repudiation of the doctrine of collective responsibility</div>

<p>The progressive clarification of the moral consciousness
in Israel disclosed by this truer conception of the divine
character is further shown by the definite and emphatic repudiation
by the prophets of the Exile of the doctrine of
collective responsibility.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>There was an ironical proverb current in Israel, which,
expressing bitter protest against the unequal ways of Yahweh
in visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children,<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> ran
thus: “The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s
teeth are set on edge.”<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> The prophet Ezekiel says to
the people that they shall not have occasion any more to use
this proverb.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> With clear moral vision he sees how impossible
it is that the moral government of Yahweh should rest upon
the principle of collective responsibility, and that the innocent
should be punished for the guilty. Declaring that the ways
of God are just and equal, he annuls all earlier provisions of
the law by boldly proclaiming that the son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the
iniquity of the son.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p>It marks a great moral advance when guilt comes thus to
be viewed as a personal and not a communal thing. But unfortunately
the ground here gained for morality was lost when
the theologians of the early Christian Church, reviving the
outgrown conception of collective responsibility, formulated
the dogma that all the generations of men—such being the
solidarity of the human race—are partakers in the sin of
the first parents and under condemnation therefor.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of the sufferings of the righteous as vicarious and expiatory</div>

<p>But the decisive rejection by the deepening moral consciousness
in Israel of the doctrine that under the moral
government of Yahweh the innocent are punished for the
guilty left still unsolved the problem of the sufferings of the
righteous—that problem which had at all times so troubled
the pious Israelite, and for the solution of which so many
different theories had been framed. The new teaching, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the implication of the new teaching, that such sufferings are
not penal in character, that they are no sign of God’s displeasure
with the sufferer, while a teaching of consolation,
contributed nothing to the actual solution of the problem.
But a new theory now offers a new interpretation. This
theory assumes that all transgression must be atoned for by
suffering, but teaches that this suffering may be borne vicariously
by one not the transgressor, and the guilt thereby
expiated.</p>

<p>This idea worked itself out in the sorrow-burdened souls
of the pious exiles in Babylon. Never did acquaintance with
bitter sorrow yield sweeter fruit. The thought finds expression
in Chapters LII and LIII of Isaiah.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> The righteous
Servant of Yahweh, who is despised and rejected of
men, a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief, is the
personified community of the pious Israelites, who are
wounded for the transgressions and bruised for the iniquities
of the nation.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p>Of all the ethical products of the troublous life of Israel,
this idea that under the moral government of the world one
may vicariously bear the burden of another’s fault and thus
atone for it was the most important in its historical consequences.
Six hundred years after the utterance of this message
of consolation to the pious Israelite exiles, the ideal of the
suffering Servant of Yahweh, thus held aloft by the Great
Unknown, was incarnated, so it was believed, in Jesus of
Nazareth. Clothed in actual flesh and blood, the sweet persuasiveness
of the ideal—the nobility and divineness of
suffering voluntarily borne in the stead of another—made
unwonted appeal to the heart of humanity, and for eighteen
hundred years and more, accepted as a true symbol and
interpretation of the moral order, it has been a chief molding
force in the moral life of the Western world.</p>

<h4 id="toclink_162"><i>3. The Moral Life in the Postexilic Age</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">A ritual morality</div>

<p>The chief moral fact in the postexilic period<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> was the
putting into strict practice of the Levitical and Deuteronomic
law, and the consequent triumph of ritual morality. From
the establishment of this law till the rise of Christianity,
orthodox morality in Judah consisted in the careful observance
of the thousand and one minute rules and requirements of
this Temple code. The good man was he who kept the law
of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> All duties were in a sense religious duties;
they were acts performed simply because of the supposed
divine command that they should be performed.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></p>

<p>Such dependence as this on rules and forms and rites is of
course disastrous to all true morality. It fosters the idea that
morality consists in the performance of certain outer acts,
instead of being the attitude of the soul toward the good and
the right inwardly discerned. It substitutes an outer standard
for the individual conscience. Conscience disused loses its
power of discrimination and becomes atrophied. The ethically
indifferent is made the all-important, and thus all moral
values are confused.</p>

<p>What confusion resulted in Israel is revealed in the denunciations
of this rigid, mechanical legalism by the Prophet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Nazareth: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have
omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy,
and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave
the other undone.”<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> “Not that which goeth into the mouth
defileth a man, but that which cometh out of the mouth....
To eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.”<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p>

<p>The Sermon on the Mount announces the awakening of
the true prophetic spirit in Israel after a sleep of five hundred
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An intolerant nationalism</div>

<p>A sinister phase of the orthodox religious-ethical system of
the postexilic age was its narrow, intolerant nationalism. To
be an enemy of Israel was what was believed to constitute
wickedness, and to excite the wrath of Yahweh, just as later
in the ethics of certain systems of Christian theology the unbeliever
or pagan, merely because of his unbelief or paganism,
was regarded as wicked and as deserving of eternal punishment.
In psalms which date from this period these enemies
of Yahweh are cursed with a fierce hatred which spares not
even the children, but pronounces happy him who shall take
up and dash the little ones against the stones.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> Nowhere
in history do we meet with a more fanatically intolerant
nationalism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The relation of the synagogue to the moral evolution</div>

<p>It was only a comparatively small part of the Jewish nation
whose home was the city of Jerusalem in the later postexilic
period. The Israelite community was now widely scattered in
the cities of the East and the West. One important outcome
of this, in its bearings upon the moral life of Israel and of the
nations that were to receive ethical instruction from her, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the establishment of the synagogue.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> For the Deuteronomic
code had made religion to be something connected with the
Temple, something separate and apart from true morality,
whose root is in human relationships. Now the Dispersion,
tearing the Israelites away from the Temple, tended to bring
into prominence those religious exercises and those duties
which had nothing to do with the Temple service. This was
favorable to the religion and morality of the prophets, as opposed
to the religion and morality of the priests. The services
of the synagogue took the place of the ceremonies and
sacrifices of the Temple.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> These services consisted in the
reading and translation of a portion of the Scriptures with
comments thereupon.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> This meant the incoming of a new
and powerful agency in the promotion not only of the religious
but also of the moral education of humanity, for this
custom “was the origin of the homily and sermon.”<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> The
synagogue was the prototype and precursor of the Christian
basilica and the Puritan meetinghouse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new doctrine of immortality: its ethical import</div>

<p>The reëstablishment of the Law we have pronounced the
chief ethical fact in the history of Judaism after the return
from the Babylonian Captivity. And this is true if it is the
history of the Jews alone that we have in mind; but regarding
the moral evolution in the world at large there is another
fact belonging to this period of even greater importance. This
was the incoming of the doctrine of immortality.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a></p>

<p>We have seen that from the first the Hebrews, like the
Babylonians, held a belief in a sort of shadowy existence
after death;<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> but of a belief in personal immortality in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
sense of the word, of a life of rewards and punishments beyond
the grave, there is no certain trace in Hebrew literature
until about the third or second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></p>

<p>Different influences had concurred to create this new conception
of the hereafter and to secure for it by the end of the
Greek period a wide acceptance. First, there was what has
been called the subjective sense of fellowship with God. During
this period of Israelite history there was engendered in
select souls a passionate outreaching after divine companionship.
This feeling is revealed in many a postexilic psalm, as
where the psalmist exclaims, “For thou wilt not leave my soul
to Sheol; neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one [beloved] to
see corruption.”<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> This was the divination of love like that of
the old mystic who exclaimed, “O God, if I should die, Thou
couldst not live.”<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> It was such filial love and trust as this,
which found its divinest expression in the life of “the
Sublime Mystic of Galilee,” that created in many a devout
soul in Israel that larger hope which gave birth to the doctrine
of personal immortality.</p>

<p>But while it was probably deep religious feeling, the soul’s
recognition of its sonship to God, that called into existence
the idea of personal immortality, it was the ethical necessity
created by a profound faith in God’s absolute justice, an irrefragable
conviction that under the moral government of the
world well-doing will be rewarded and evildoing punished,
that gained for the doctrine its wide acceptance. That good
men should be afflicted and wicked men should enjoy prosperity,
has in all ages of reflection caused questionings and
murmurings. But this ethical problem filled with peculiar
unrest the souls of the Israelites, first, because more than any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
other people they felt the need of a just God; and second,
because of their lack of belief in a future life of rewards and
punishments in which the wrongs and inequalities of this life
might be righted. Hence the many different solutions of the
problem which they thought out, and through which they
sought to justify the ways of God to man. So long, however,
as life practically ended at the grave, the problem remained
insolvable. But the doctrine of another existence in which
the righteous man should receive compensation for his sufferings
here, and the evil man just retribution for his deeds,
offered a reasonable solution of the problem that had so troubled
the conscience of Israel. It was this undoubtedly that
caused the teaching to gain popular currency.</p>

<p>The doctrine, however, was not wholly the product of the
religious and ethical development within Israel. Its growth
was fostered by various outside influences. Among these
was the Persian doctrine of the resurrection and a future
life of retributive justice, with which the Jews became familiar
at the time of the Exile in Babylon or later in the Persian
period. Then again the development of the idea was stimulated,
after the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, by Greek philosophy,
particularly the Platonic.</p>

<p>But far more influential than either Zoroastrian teachings
or Greek philosophy must have been the thought and conviction
of ancient Egypt. After the founding of Alexandria,
toward the end of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, a vast number of
Jews were settled in that capital; and though the positive
evidence here is very meager, still we have a right to something
more than a conjecture that in that city Judaism was
deeply influenced by the ancient Egyptian doctrine of
immortality.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></p>

<p>Under these various influences this doctrine rooted itself
firmly among the Jews, and by the time of the appearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Christ had become a distinctive tenet of a large and influential
party among them.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></p>

<p>After the conception of a just God and the ideal of the suffering
Servant of Yahweh, this doctrine of immortality, with
its correlate teaching of future rewards and punishments,
was perhaps the most important product, in its moral consequences,
of the life and ethical experiences of ancient Israel.
It exercised little or no influence, at least no decisive influence,
upon the moral evolution in Judaism, but, adopted by
Christianity, it was given new force and currency, and for
eighteen hundred years and more has been one of the great
bulwarks and sanctions of morality in the Western world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The expansion of the moral sympathies in the Hellenistic Age</div>

<p>We have spoken of the rigid legalism and the narrow
nationalistic spirit of orthodox postexilic Judaism. But it
must not be thought that in these last days the spirit of
prophetism was dead. Hidden beneath this hard rind of legalism
there pulsed a true moral life. This life found expression
in a movement toward ethical universalism. To understand
this movement we must recall the great political revolution
of this epoch.</p>

<p>Almost exactly two centuries after the return of the Jews
from the Babylonian Captivity, all the political relations of the
Semitic East were abruptly ended and new relations established
by the conquests of Alexander the Great. Hellenism,
the most powerful solvent of history, now came in contact
with Hebrew life and thought both in Palestine and in Egypt.
The effect upon the ethical development in Judaism was profound.
With the expansion of the political and mental horizons
the moral sympathies of men were widened. The wall
of separation between Jew and Gentile was thrown down. In
Alexandria and in the many new Hellenistic cities in Asia,
the nobler spirits of dispersed Israel, casting aside their narrow
racial prejudices, with enlarged mental vision and widened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
moral sympathies, came to read with new understanding
their great prophets who had preached the universality of
the moral law and the brotherhood of nations.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> Hebrew
literature registers the change. This new spirit of internationalism,
of kindness and justice even to enemies, breathes
from many of the later psalms<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> and speaks from many
a passage of the so-called “wisdom books” of the period.
The allegory of Jonah embodies the liberal spirit of this new
Judaism. The great lawyers Hillel and Shammai,<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> who laid
emphasis upon social duties and human service, represented
the humanitarian phase of the age movement. Philo, the
Alexandrian Jew, represented its philosophical side. The
way was being prepared for the incoming of the ethical
universalism of Christianity.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HELLAS: AN IDEAL
OF SELF-REALIZATION</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Introduction</div>

<p>The Greek ethical ideal, a creation of the natural feelings
and impulses of the human mind and heart uninfluenced by
theological doctrines, was one of the most imperishable products
of Greek life and thought. This conception of what
constitutes good life became a part of the Greek bequest to
civilization. The modern world is thus indebted to Greece
not only for priceless elements of its intellectual and art life,
but for precious elements of its moral life as well. Throughout
the medieval age, it is true, it was the ethical heritage
from Judea that shaped and colored the moral ideal of the
European peoples, but even during that period this Semitic
ideal bore the deep impress of Greek ethics, while ever since
the Renaissance it is the ethical bequest of Hellas which has
steadily become an ever more and more dominant factor in
the moral life of the Western nations. The conscience of the
modern world of science is Hellenic rather than Hebraic.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_169a">I. <span class="smcap">Institutions and Ideas determining the Moral
Type</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The city state the mold of Greek morality and the chief sphere of Greek moral activity</div>

<p>The Greek city state was the creator of the Greek conscience;
that is to say, the relationships and activities of the
Greek as a citizen, and not his relationships and activities as
a husband or father or business man, determined his chief
duties. Conscience was very little involved in that part of
his life which lay outside the civic sphere. It was solely as
a member of a city community, which was to the Greek what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
the Church was to the man of medieval times, that he could
live the truly moral life and attain the highest virtue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greek view of man’s nature as good</div>

<p>The common Greek view of man’s nature was like that of
the Chinese moralists; that is, it conceived human nature as
being essentially good.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> And this conception included the
whole of man’s nature, his body as well as his spirit. As we
shall learn, this doctrine influenced profoundly the Greek
conception of what is permissible and right in conduct. It
made it seem right to give full, though regulated and reasonable,
indulgence to the bodily impulses and instincts. It
made the fundamental maxim of Greek morality to be, Live
according to nature. It left no place in Greek thought
for the Oriental notion of an antagonism between the flesh
and the spirit. Hence asceticism with its repressions of the
bodily instincts and appetites, which is so common an expression
of the moral sentiment among the Oriental races, found
no place in Greek morality till after Greek culture had come
in contact with the religious and ethical systems of Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The idea of harmony in the god world</div>

<p>Closely connected with this idea of the essential goodness
and oneness of man’s nature was the conception of unity
and harmony in the god world. In passing from the Orient
to Greece we leave behind not only Indian pessimism, but
Egyptian and Persian dualism. We leave behind that conception
of disharmony and conflict in the invisible world
which is such a characteristic phase of much of Oriental
thought. We hear, indeed, the faint echo of a prehistoric
struggle between the earth gods and the sky gods. But all
now is peace. The Titans are chained, and the gods that
are the friends of men reign supreme.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>Just as that Oriental dualistic world philosophy exercised
a vast influence upon the moral ideals of the East and of the
later Christian world that inherited that system of thought,
making the moral life serious and strenuous, a fight against
evil, so did the opposing Greek conception of unity and harmony
in the god world exert a profound influence upon Greek
morality, emptying the moral life of everything like strenuousness
and battle. It made Greek morality to be like the
morality of sensuous, joyous youth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The character of the Greek gods</div>

<p>In strong contrast to Hebrew morality, which, as we have
seen, was almost exclusively a religious one, springing, that
is to say, from certain conceptions of God’s character and of
his relations to man, Greek morality was in the main a lay
or secular one. Aristotle, who gave scientific form to Greek
ethics, allowed hardly any place in the moral code to religious
duties. Yet, though the Greek moral ideal was not based upon
religion, it was influenced by it; for there cannot be an entire
separation of religion and morality. Religious beliefs, like beliefs
of every other kind, help to shape men’s ideas of what
is right and what is wrong in conduct.</p>

<p>The influence of the Greek religion upon Greek morality
was not wholly favorable. The attribution by the Greeks of
human frailties and vices to their gods tended to depress
human morality, since men are never better than their gods.
It is true that the moral character of the gods of any people
is a creation of the moral consciousness of that people; still,
after once called into existence and enthroned, these divinities
react upon their creators and shape in a greater or less degree
the moral character of their worshipers.</p>

<p>But though there were elements in some of the Greek
cults, particularly in those of Dionysus<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> and Aphrodite in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
later period,<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> that were harmful to morality, still in general
Greek morality found in religion at once a restraining and a
stimulating influence.</p>

<p>Even as early as the Homeric Age religion had become
a moral force. It is the fear of the gods even more than
the fear of men which is the motive force for rightdoing.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a>
Odysseus’ request of Ilus of Ephyra for poison with which to
smear the points of his arrows is refused through fear of the
divine anger, and Priam in praying Achilles for the body of
Hector admonishes him to have reverence for the gods.</p>

<p>And throughout later times the gods are the guardians of
morality. They are the avengers of perjury. They are the
punishers of him who breaks the law of hospitality. Especially
does Zeus, as the god of hospitality, “take note of those
who welcome and those who maltreat the stranger.”<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> The
shrines of all the gods are places of refuge and sanctuary.
The suppliant at the altar is sacrosanct. Here the hand of
the avenger of injury is stayed. “Mercy,” says Sophocles,
“shares the judgment seat of Zeus.” As the god of the suppliant,
Zeus not only protects but purifies and delivers. Thus
were the high moral qualities of mercy and forgiveness thrown
into relief, and men, while taught self-restraint, were imbued
with reverence for these attributes of character.</p>

<p>This high morality of the Greek religion reached its culmination
in the worship of the Delphian Apollo. In truth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
the history of Delphi is a large part of the history of Greek
morality. It reflected from age to age the deepening moral
perceptions of the race. The oracle thus stood in close relation
with the great teachers of Greece. The ethical impulse
of Pythagoreanism seems to have gone forth from Delphi.
Apollo gave a religious sanction to the emancipation of the
slave, and thus promoted social morality. The slave given his
freedom by his master at Delphi became, as a freedman, sacrosanct.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a>
Apollo stimulated also political morality. Through
the Delphic Amphictyony his influence was exerted in mitigating
the barbarities of war between Greek and Greek, and
in creating an Hellenic fraternity. Thus through religion
was the narrow sphere embraced by the ordinary moral feelings
of the Greeks broadened and brought to cover wide
federations of cities and tribes.</p>

<p>Greek religion also exercised a stimulating influence upon
morality through the Mysteries, especially through those of
Eleusis. The greater number of these religious fraternities
had an ethical aim—“the aim of worshiping a pure god,
the aim of living a pure life, and the aim of cultivating a
spirit of brotherhood.”<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Significance for Greek morality of the absence of a priestly caste</div>

<p>But the most noteworthy fact concerning Greek religion
in its relations to Greek morality is this—that it was a religion
practically without a priesthood. For there never arose
in Greece a priestly class like that in Egypt, in Persia, in
India, and in Judea. This is a fact of supreme importance
in the history of Greek morals. It prevented the growth of
a theocratic morality, with its artificial ritual duties and its
conservative tendencies.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that it was the early rise of philosophy
in the Greek cities of Ionia that saved Hellas from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
domination of a sacerdotal caste. For at the time this philosophy
arose the Orphic doctrines were overspreading Greece.
Now this was a priestly religion, that is, a religion interpreted
and administered by priests. Its triumph in Greece would
have meant the establishment of a powerful national priesthood.
This misfortune was prevented by the intellectual and
philosophical movement in Ionia. It is this fact which leads
Professor Bury to pronounce the rise of the study of philosophy
in the Ionian cities one of the most important facts in
the history of Hellas; for “it meant the triumph of reason
over mystery; it led to the discrediting of the Orphic movement;
it insured the free political and social progress of
Hellas.”<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> And all this meant the keeping of the ground clear
for the upgrowth and development of an essentially lay or
secular morality, a morality that found its sanctions alone in
the human reason and conscience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of race election; Hellenes and Barbarians</div>

<p>There was one conception common to both Greek and Jew
which reacted powerfully upon the moral system of each.
This was what has been called the doctrine of race election.
The Jews believed themselves to be the “chosen people.”
The Greeks believed the same concerning themselves. They
were the intellectually elect people. All other peoples were
“barbarians.” Just as the Jewish doctrine of election excluded
the Gentile world from the pale of Jewish moral sympathies,
so did the Greek doctrine of separateness cause the Greek
to shut out from his moral sympathies the entire non-Greek
world. We shall see a little further on how this race egotism
dictated large sections of the Greek code of morals.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_174">II. <span class="smcap">The Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Patriotism the cardinal virtue; civic and military duties</div>

<p>As we have already noticed, it was out of his relations as a
citizen that the primary duties of the Greek arose. His
supreme duty was patriotism, devotion to his city. “Good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
citizen” and “good man” were interchangeable terms. And
since a state of war rather than of peace was the normal relation
of the Greek cities, the military virtues held the highest
place in the ideal of excellence. “Their bodies,”—thus
Thucydides makes one of his characters speak of the citizen
soldiers of a typical Greek city—“their bodies they devote
to their country as though they belonged to other men.”<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a>
Thus the preëminent Greek virtue, courage, was almost synonymous
with valor in war. To throw away one’s shield
was the last infamy with the Greeks as with the Romans.</p>

<p>This type of character, blending the civic and the military
virtues, is presented to us with incomparable charm in
Plutarch’s <i>Lives</i>. Here we see the ideal in actual flesh and
blood. It is the altruistic element in this type of character
which renders it so morally attractive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greek virtue of courage a form of our virtue of self-sacrifice</div>

<p>For we should not fail to note that in the Greek enumeration
of the virtues, the virtue of self-sacrifice, which we give
the first place in our own moral ideal, is hidden under courage
or fortitude.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> With us this virtue expresses itself in a
great variety of forms; with the Greeks, in one form chiefly—self-devotion
on the battlefield. This altruism, it is true, was
narrow; it did not look beyond one’s own city; but notwithstanding
this limitation it was genuine altruism, for facing
death in battle, as Aristotle says, is “the greatest and noblest
of perils.”<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> This ready self-devotion of the individual to the
common interests of his city was the most attractive feature
of Greek morality. It formed the basis of Greek civilization.
When this virtue was lost the Greek city perished, and with
it Greek civilization passed away.</p>

<p>Among all the cities of Greece, Sparta realized most perfectly
the military virtues of the Greek ideal. The great place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
so long held by her in the ancient world she won through
the loyalty of her citizens to the soldier’s ideal of obedience,
courage, and self-devotion. The conduct of Leonidas and
his companions in the pass of Thermopylæ not only had
a bracing effect upon Greek character for generations, but
has never ceased, through the inspiration of example, to add
to the sum total in the world of loyalty to duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The virtues of temperance and justice</div>

<p>To the virtue of self-sacrifice, under the guise of fortitude,
or the facing of danger or the endurance of pain in a worthy
cause, the Greeks added temperance, justice, and wisdom.</p>

<p>The Greek virtue of temperance or moderation was essentially
the same as our virtue of self-control or self-denial. It
meant measure in all things, the avoidance of the too much
and the too little.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> Everything must be in fair proportion.
In building a house one should not go “beyond bounds in
size, magnificence, and expense.” In conduct likewise the
mean must always be the aim. Restraint must be laid upon
one’s appetites and desires. Excessive ambition was a grave
fault, as was an undue lack of ambition.</p>

<p>The Greek conception of justice was this: Do no wrong,
and suffer no wrong to self or to others—with the emphasis
on the latter part of the injunction.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> Christianity shifted the
emphasis to the first part of the commandment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The virtue of wisdom; mental self-culture a duty</div>

<p>By the term “wisdom” the Greeks covered very nearly
what we mean by mental self-culture. Now there has been a
wide divergence of opinion among different peoples respecting
this matter. Primitive races can of course have no feeling
of obligation as to intellectual self-culture; but even a people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
as advanced in civilization as the Romans may have little or
no conscience concerning it. Throughout a great part of the
medieval age in Europe mental culture was looked upon
with suspicion. Very few regarded it as a duty. But since
the Renaissance, that is, since the rebirth in the European
world of the Greek spirit, intellectual culture has been coming
to be regarded more and more as an urgent and imperious
duty. It is to the ancient Greeks, as implied in what we
have just said, that we are largely indebted for this ethical
feeling. To the truly representative Greek the ethical imperative
to seek self-realization called especially for the development
of the mind, “his true self.” Mere intellectual curiosity,
love of knowledge for its own sake, was, it is true, one
of the creative forces of Greek intellectualism; but the
ethical motive was ever near. In the Socratic philosophy
indeed it is made the dominant motive for the reason that
virtuous conduct is by Socrates held to be dependent upon
knowledge, the knowledge of things as they really are, things
human and divine. With the philosopher the gaining of this
knowledge is the aim and end of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The development of the body a duty; the ethical element in Greek athleticism</div>

<p>Asceticism, a chief characteristic of which is the conception
that there is something meritorious in the illtreatment
or neglect of the body, is one of the most striking phenomena
in the moral history of mankind. The Oriental peoples
especially have ever been easily persuaded, under the influence
of religious ideas, that the body should be illtreated in
the interest of the spirit.</p>

<p>In passing from Asia to Greece we seem to enter a new
ethical atmosphere. We leave behind every trace of asceticism.
We are no longer surrounded by unkempt, gaunt, hollow-eyed
fakirs, anchorites, and monks. In Greek thought, as
we have seen, there was no trace of that Oriental idea of
a warring between body and spirit. This happy consciousness
of the Greek of harmony in his own being had most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
important consequences for Greek morality. It made the
development of the body, equally with that of the soul, an
ethical requirement. The outcome was Greek athleticism, one
of the most attractive phases of Hellenic civilization.</p>

<p>We do not mean to say that moral feeling was to the same
degree active in calling into existence Greek athleticism that
religious-ethical feeling was active in the creation of Oriental
asceticism, but simply that the ethical motive held a place
among the various motives and sentiments at work. Without
this motive the Olympian games and the other sacred festivals
into which athletic exercises and competitions entered,
would never have won the place they held in Greek life and
culture. When in later times these festivals, subjected to
commercial and mercenary influences, lost wholly or in part
this religious-ethical element, then they lost also their distinctive
character, and that morally wholesome and uplifting
influence which they had exercised upon the Greek world
throughout the best days of Hellas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Identification of moral goodness with beauty</div>

<p>Just as the cultured Greek brought the intellectual domain
of life within the province of morals, so likewise did he with
the æsthetic. It was not merely his æsthetic sense which was
offended by ugliness in form, but also his moral sense. To
the Greek mind, to love beauty, sensuous and spiritual, and to
be beautiful was synonymous with being good. “He who is
beautiful to look upon,” says Sappho, “is good; and who is
good will soon be beautiful.”<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> “The beautiful,” comments
Wuttke in speaking of this phase of Greek ethics, “is <i lang="la">per se</i>
the good; in enjoying and creating the beautiful man is
moral.”<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> “The ‘good’ and the ‘beautiful’”—thus G. Lowes
Dickinson sums up the Greek view—“were one and the same
thing; that is the first and the last word of the Greek ideal.”<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>This identification by the Greeks of goodness with beauty
is one of the most important matters in Greek ethics. For
the conception was not with them an inert thing. Greek
civilization in all its phases was in a great measure the expression
of this conviction. The Greeks filled the world with
beautiful things because to create beauty was with them an
ethical as well as an æsthetic impulse and necessity. They
felt the holiness of beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Live according to nature sums up all moral requirements</div>

<p>All the particular requirements of Greek morality, some of
the most important of which we have now briefly commented
upon, are summed up in the formula, Live conformably to
nature. The idea here embodied of what constitutes man’s full
duty springs naturally from the doctrine that man’s nature
is essentially good. If that nature be good, then virtuousness
will consist in the well-rounded symmetrical development of
all the capacities of body and mind. Pindar’s profound injunction,
“Be what you are,” embodies the essence of the
teachings of the Greek moralists. They taught that man
fulfills his destiny by becoming what he is in his innermost
being—by complete self-realization.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_179">III. <span class="smcap">Limitations and Defects of the Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Its aristocratic character</div>

<p>A chief defect of Greek ethics was its aristocratic spirit.
So many were the classes excluded in whole or in part from
the moral field that Greek morality was almost as much a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
class morality as that of Brahmanic India. Entire races and
classes were as completely outside the moral pale as is the
Indian pariah. It was only the higher cultured classes of
citizens who, the moral philosophers taught, were capable
of attaining the noblest virtues and living the truly moral
life. All others were regarded as living on a semimoral or
nonmoral animal plane of existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The exclusion of non-Greek races from the moral sphere</div>

<p>Thus throughout a great part of the historic period the
Greeks virtually excluded all non-Greek peoples from the
moral domain.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> They regarded these non-Hellenic folk about
as we regard animals, or as many a few generations ago looked
upon the black race. They thought it right for them to make
unprovoked war upon such people and to make slaves of those
they might capture. Aristotle taught that to hunt barbarians
for the purpose of getting slaves was just as right and proper as
to hunt animals for food or sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> In a word, non-Greeks
were regarded as being practically outside the pale of humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The exclusion of slaves</div>

<p>The moral status of the slave in ancient Greece was
determined by the fact that slaves were usually barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a>
Since as non-Greeks they were already outside the moral
pale, it followed naturally that as slaves they had no standing
in the court of morals. Their status was almost the same
as that of domestic animals. The Greek master never felt
that he owed any moral duties to his slaves, though kind
and merciful treatment of them was enjoined by the philosophers
and moralists. According to Aristotle, the relation of
slave and master is a purely natural one, like that of body
and soul. He calls slaves “living instruments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The exclusion of the domestic sphere</div>

<p>Out of the family relationships arise a large part of the
duties making up the moral code of the modern Western
world, while in the atmosphere of the domestic circle are
nourished many of what we regard as the most sacred and
attractive of the virtues. Now these family virtues, which we
esteem so highly, found only a very subordinate place in the
Greek ideal of character, for the reason that the family, like
the clan and the tribe, was almost absorbed by the city. In
Sparta the family and family life practically disappeared.
In Plato’s ideal republic the family is sacrificed to the state.</p>

<p>The status of the wife in most of the Greek cities was a
low one. She was practically one of the slaves. Ethical sentiment,
as was true of the sentiment of romantic love, seems
to have been almost wholly lacking in the marriage relation.</p>

<p>Infancy, in its earliest stages, was in general never brought
beneath the protecting ægis of the moral sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> In the
practice of the exposure of ill-formed, weak, defective, or
unpromising newborn infants the Greeks, like the Romans,
never advanced much beyond the standpoint of barbarians.
This abandonment or destruction by parents of their offspring
did not offend the common conscience. Even the philosophers
and moralists saw nothing in the practice to censure. Evidence
of how general the custom was, is afforded by various tales
and dramas which turn on the rescue of the hero in his infancy
after having been cast out to die.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> The story of King
Œdipus is typical.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<p>In this connection a word must be said regarding chastity.
We find here one of the most serious defects of Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
morality. The virtue of chastity was given a very low place,
hardly any place at all, in the Greek ideal of character. It
was the undervaluing of this virtue that without doubt was
one of the contributing causes of the decline and early decay
of Greek civilization.</p>

<p>Another equally grave defect in the Greek moral character
was lack of respect for the aged. Save at Sparta and Athens,
age was not reverenced in ancient Greece.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> In this respect
the Greeks stood almost on a level with most primitive races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The disesteem of industrial virtues</div>

<p>A marked characteristic of Greek ethical feeling was a
deep prejudice against manual and commercial occupations
as unworthy of freemen. Aristotle taught that there was
“no room for moral excellence” in the trades and employments
of artisans, traders, and laborers.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> Even artists like
Phidias and Polyclitus were looked upon as “miserable
handicraftsmen.”<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> Plato in his <i>Laws</i> says: “He who in
any way shares in the illiberality of retail trade may be
indicted by any one who likes for dishonoring his race,
before those who are judged to be first in virtue; and if
he appear to throw dirt upon his father’s house,—by an unworthy
occupation,—let him be imprisoned for a year and
abstain from that sort of thing.”<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> In some cities the person
who engaged in trade was disqualified for citizenship, and in
others no mechanic or field laborer could enter the place
where the freemen met.</p>

<p>This feeling that labor is degrading came in after the
Homeric Age, with the rule of the oligarchs, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
the natural and inevitable outcome of slavery. The effect
of slavery is to make work seem ignoble and servile, and to
cause the industrial virtues to assume a low place in the
moral ideal, or to drop out of it entirely. The high place
assigned the industrial virtues in the moral ideals of ancient
Persia and Israel was due probably as largely to the subordinate
place which slavery held in those countries as to the
influence of religious doctrines and physical environment.</p>

<p>Another ground for the feeling was that hard, coarse work
destroys the suppleness and mars the beauty and symmetry of
the body; and this to the Greek way of thinking was sufficient
reason why the freeman—to use Plato’s phrase—“should
abstain from that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Still another reason for the feeling that the retail trades
were unworthy of citizens was the conviction that this kind
of business had “a strong tendency to make men bad.” The
small merchants and traders in Greece certainly bore a very
bad reputation,<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> and it is probable that the public disesteem
of their occupation and the contempt in which they themselves
were held had the same sinister influence upon them
that the similar feeling in Old Japan had upon the petty
trader there.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Revenge reckoned as a virtue</div>

<p>In nothing did the ordinary Greek moral consciousness
differ more widely from the Christian than in the matter of
forgiving injuries. This was one of the virtues brought in by
Christianity which to the Greek mind was foolishness. To
the Greek the taking of revenge upon an enemy was a duty.
A man should render himself useful to his friends and dangerous
to his enemies. The Greek orator, in order to justify
his resentment toward any one, always took pains to show
that he had been injured in some way by the person, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
hence had good ground for wishing to do him evil. Indeed,
one who neglected to take revenge upon his personal enemy
was looked upon as a weak, pusillanimous creature.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a></p>

<p>But out of this virtue of revenge, paradoxically enough,
arose the virtue of forgiveness; for revenge was limited by
the requirements of the virtue of moderation or self-restraint.
The person seeking revenge for an injury must set reasonable
bounds to his thirst for vengeance. Hence when the age
of reflection came there were teachers of spiritual insight who,
regarding the matter from this point of view, saw forgiveness
to be a virtue because it required in the one forgiving great
self-conquest and self-control.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Low estimation of truthfulness</div>

<p>Another serious defect in the ordinary Greek moral standard
was the low place assigned to the virtue of veracity. The
Greeks, in marked contrast to the ancient Persians, had only
a very feeble sense of the sanctity of the plighted word. Untruthfulness
was ingrained in the nation. The Homeric heroes
were full of guile and deceit, and the historic Greeks were
little better. They had throughout the ancient world a well-earned
reputation for disregard of promises and oaths. When
it seemed to them necessary to lie in order to gain a desired
end, then lying appeared to them justifiable. Scythas, tyrant
of Zancle, if we may judge from a story told by Herodotus,
was the only Greek who kept his word to Darius. This man
was in exile at Susa. He obtained from the king permission,
presumably on parole, to visit Sicily, and honorably
returned to Persia. The conduct of Scythas in this matter
must have been exceptional, for, in the words of Herodotus,
“him Darius regarded the most upright of all the Greeks
to whom he afforded a refuge.”<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>The great moral teachers of Greece recognized this defect
in the moral character of their countrymen and sought to correct
it by extolling the virtue of truthfulness. After the Persian
war a class of men arose, historians and philosophers, whom
Schmidt, because of their reverence for truth, calls the ancestors
of the modern men of science.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> Thucydides had the
same sense of the sanctity of exactness in statement of fact as
has the historian of to-day. Socrates died rather than cloak
the truth before his judges. Aristotle said, “Friends and truth
are both dear to us, but it is a sacred duty to prefer the truth.”<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_185">IV. <span class="smcap">The Moral Evolution</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The morality of the Homeric Age</div>

<p>The historical starting point of the moral evolution in Greece
is the morality of the Homeric Age. This morality we find
incarnated in the heroes of the time, Achilles and Odysseus,
for, as Wundt observes, “the inmost moral convictions of a
people are shown far more plainly in the character of its heroes
than in its gods.”<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></p>

<p>The qualities of character with which, as worthy of admiration,
the poet invests his heroes show that, notwithstanding
the great advance already achieved in many of the arts of life,
in morality the Greeks of this age were still in some respects
on a level with savages. Thus the poet extols the “good
Autolycus” for his skill in thievery and perjury.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> But stealing
and lying, as with uncivilized people generally, to be proper
and right, must be adroit and “for the good of friends and
the harm of enemies.” Piracy was an honorable occupation.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a>
The bodies of enemies slain in battle were maltreated, as is
the wont of savages.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> Conceptions of deity were crude and
unethical, the gods being represented as capricious, profligate,
partial, and unjust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>But there was a sound core in this morality. Clan virtues
were firmly inwrought in character. The virtue of loyalty to
comrades was strong; the ethical qualities of courage and
self-devotion for the common good, and of hospitality to
strangers were well developed; and the domestic virtues of
chastity and constancy in woman are portrayed in such a way
as to show that, if not common, they were at least held in
high esteem and reverence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reprobation by the philosophers and later poets of the Homeric tales of the gods</div>

<p>From the Homeric Age onward there was a progressive
purification of the moral feelings. One evidence of this ethical
progress is found in the repudiation by the later moral
consciousness of the primitive myths of the gods. These
tales, as we have just noted, were coarse, sensual, and immoral.
The philosophers of the sixth and following centuries,
and the poets of this later time, denounced these stories
as unworthy and unethical conceptions of deity. Pythagoras
is said, upon his return from Hades, to have reported seeing
there the souls of Homer and Hesiod undergoing punishment
for what they had said of the gods. Pindar purges the tales
of their grosser immoral elements. Others sought to relieve
the poets of the charge of impiety by reading the myths as
allegories. The Sophists and Stoics moralized them, giving
them an ethical aim and purpose.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> Plato, in reprobating what
Hesiod says of Uranus, declared it “the greatest of all lies
in high places.” He would strike out from the poets all passages
in which they told these lies about the gods and heroes,
before allowing the boys and men to read them.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> In the
hands of the later Attic tragedians the whole traditionary
religious mythology was spiritualized and given a deeper
ethical content and meaning.</p>

<p>This purifying of the Greek moral consciousness finds an
exact parallel in what is taking place in the modern Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
world respecting the conceptions of deity found in the early
chronicles of the Hebrew Bible and transmitted as a religious
bequest to the European peoples. These ideas of God
are rejected by the truer moral consciousness of to-day as
the crude notions of a gross and morally immature age. Just
as this modern rejection of these unworthy primitive conceptions
of the divine character register our own moral advance,
so does the rejection, by the later Greek thinkers and teachers,
of the Homeric and Hesiodic conceptions of the gods register
the advance in ethical thought in Greece during the interval
that separates the era of these poets from the Solonian and
Platonic Ages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethical significance of the transition from the continuance to the retribution theory</div>

<p>In an earlier chapter we spoke of the continuance theory
of life after death, and of the retribution theory as marking
an advance upon this in ethical feeling.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> At the opening of
the historical period in Greece we find the primitive unethical
continuance theory in existence, but in a state of transition
into the retribution theory. The early Greek Hades, like the
Babylonian Arallu and the Hebrew Sheol, was a place where
moral distinctions were not recognized. The same phantom
life was the lot of all alike who went down to the world of
shadows. The Elysian Fields, it is true, had already been created,
but these were simply a sort of aristocratic heaven, a
“Greek Valhalla,” the abode of the great heroes of the race;<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a>
and Tartarus also had been called into existence, but this was
a prison house only for those who had incurred the special
enmity of the gods. The fables of Tantalus, Ixion, and the
Danaïdes show that the belief in an after life had no ethical
significance for the masses.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>But already in Pindar these ideas of the after life, through
virtue of an ethical necessity, have undergone great changes.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a>
Just as the poet moralizes the Homeric conception of the
gods, so does he moralize the Homeric conception of the underworld.
Alongside the continuance theory we find now the
retribution theory. The life beyond the grave is conceived as
a life of rewards and punishments. The Elysian Fields have
been “opened to moral worth,” and a tribunal, called into
existence by a growing moral consciousness like that which
created the Egyptian Judgment of the Dead, has been set
up, and Rhadamanthus apportions the destiny of souls according
to their merit and demerit.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> From the Persian war
on, the life after death had ethical significance for all men,
and not simply for exceptional cases. In the literature there
are allusions in growing numbers to the retribution awaiting
the wicked and the blessedness in store for those “unstained
with vice.”</p>

<p>In Plato this moral evolution attains a stage almost identical
with that reached by medieval Christian ethics. We find
in the <i>Republic</i> a threefold division of the realm of the dead
corresponding closely to the Schoolmen’s purgatory, heaven,
and hell.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> Punishment is conceived as having for aim and
end, in all save cases of abominable and incurable wickedness,
the purification of earth-stained souls.</p>

<p>All these modifications in the topography, the classifications,
and the arrangements of the underworld, like the similar
changes effected by the modern spirit in the medieval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
conception of hell, were the work of a gradually clarifying
moral sense, and bear witness to the progressive development
of Greek ethical thought between the Homeric and the
Alexandrian Age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The evolution of the doctrine of divine envy into that of Nemesis</div>

<p>The early Greeks held a doctrine known as the Envy of
the Gods. They imagined that the gods were envious of the
great and prosperous. Hence they thought it was the envy
of the gods which brought about the undoing of the great
and powerful. Their prayer for a friend enjoying an unusual
run of good fortune was, “May the gods not become envious.”
We find this doctrine embodied in the Herodotean story of
Crœsus, king of Lydia, whose long career of unbroken and
dazzling prosperity ends at last in dreadful reverses and
sudden downfall.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> The same belief colors the advice which
Herodotus represents Artabanus, the uncle of Xerxes, as
giving the king, who was meditating an attack on the Greek
cities. The immoderate ambition of the king, in view of the
envious nature of the gods, had awakened the apprehension
of the old and experienced counselor, and he labored to dissuade
the king from engaging in so vast a project. “Dost thou
not notice,” said he, “how the lightning smites always the
highest buildings and the tallest trees. Thus often the mighty
host is overthrown by lightning sent by the jealous gods; for
the gods are jealous of mortals, and will allow no one unduly
to exalt himself.”<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> There is here no suggestion of an ethical
element. The envious gods overthrow things simply and solely
because they are big and tall and cast them into the shade.</p>

<p>At a still later period the Athenian general Nicias gives
memorable expression to this belief in his speech to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
disheartened troops before Syracuse. He bade them take
cheer from their wretched plight because the envious gods
must certainly be disarmed by the sight of their woeful condition
and would now pity and help.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p>But alongside this unethical doctrine of the Envy of the
Gods the Greeks held another, which seems to have been
simply a modification and outgrowth of the earlier crude conception
of deity. This was the doctrine of Nemesis. There
was here full recognition of the vicissitudes of human life.
The great and the overpowerful are indeed destroyed by the
gods,—there was no denying the fact,—but not merely because
they are great, but because their greatness and their
prosperity has made them self-confident, insolent, overbearing.
In their blind arrogance they have overstepped the limits of
moderation; hence their downfall wrought by the gods.</p>

<p>It was under the spell of this belief that Herodotus wrote
his history of the Persian wars, although, as we have seen, he
loved to rehearse stories which illustrated the doctrine of the
envious nature of the gods. His narrative is in truth a great
historical drama illustrating the moral order of the world and
teaching the impressive lesson of how the gods punish presumptuous
pride and overvaulting ambition. The historian
prepares his pious readers for the final catastrophe by showing
in vivid portrayal the transactions at the Hellespont. The
swift current of the strait has broken the bridge of boats laid
upon the waters by Xerxes. The all-powerful and audacious
king orders that the sacred Hellespont be scourged with three
hundred lashes, that fetters be cast into the rebellious waters,
and that they be branded as a slave is marked with branding
irons. All this is done, and the treacherous waters are cursed
with blasphemous words.</p>

<p>Now follows quickly the tragic issue at Salamis of the vast
undertaking, and the return passage of the Hellespont a few
months later by the humbled and fugitive king. All this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
the work of Nemesis, the punisher of those who have lifted
up their hearts in insufferable pride and arrogance.</p>

<p>It is not alone in the dramatized history of Herodotus that
we are able to trace the moral effects of the Persian wars in
bringing into the foreground of the Greek consciousness the
conception of Nemesis as the vindicator of the moral government
of the world. “After the battle of Salamis,” in the
words of the historian Abbott, “the instability of human
greatness and the punishment of ‘insolence’ echoes as an
undertone through all Greek thought.”<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a></p>

<p>This deepened moral feeling of the nation found expression
both in art and in the drama. The order given by the
Athenians to Phidias to carve a statue of Nemesis as a
memorial of the war was a sanction of that interpretation of
the Persian overthrow which made it the work of the avenging
goddess. But the fullest expression of this new ethical
sentiment is found in Athenian tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> Æschylus was the
representative of this moral awakening and advance. The
doctrine of Nemesis colors all his dramas. He was the first
to give to the legend of Niobe, originally merely a tale of the
envy of Apollo, an ethical meaning as an instance of “retribution
for presumptuous sin.”<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> His imperishable tragedy
<i>Prometheus Bound</i> makes the sufferings of the Titan to be
but the just penalty of his presumption and self-will. His
<i>Agamemnon</i> depicts with tragic intensity the awful vengeance
with which the implacable goddess punishes unnatural crime.
His <i>Persians</i> teaches how Nemesis humbles insolent pride
and “Zeus tames excessive lifting up of heart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>In the later Thucydides we meet with the same teaching
concerning the moral government of the world. In a memorable
passage of his <i>History of the Peloponnesian War</i> the
historian becomes the moralist and gives his reader a tragic
illustration of the workings of the law of Nemesis. Thucydides
is approaching the chapter in his history which depicts the
terrible catastrophe which befell the Athenians in Sicily. He
skillfully foreshadows the coming tragedy by preluding his
narrative of the Sicilian Expedition with an account of the
arrogant and wicked conduct of the Athenians in driving
the Melians from their island home and adding the stolen
land to their own empire.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> This high-handed crime, like the
impiety of the presumptuous Mede at the Hellespont, arouses
the avenging Nemesis. The reader forecasts the future, and
in the cruel fate of the Melians reads the doom of the
Athenian army before Syracuse.</p>

<p>This moralizing of the primitive unethical conception of
the gods as envious and unjust, and the evolving therefrom
of the morally advanced doctrine of Nemesis, is an instructive
illustration of how, as time passed, Greek ethical feeling was
deepened and Greek ethical thought was purified and elevated
through intellectual progress and the teachings of experience.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Further moralization of the doctrine of Nemesis</div>

<p>There was a still further evolution of Greek ethical thought
along the line traced above. The mutations and tragedies of
life,—terrible reverses of fortune, sudden loss of reputation
and friends, irremediable ruin following great prosperity,—these
things are by a truer moral insight recognized as the
sign neither of the envy nor of the righteous anger of the
gods, but of the divine pity and love.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> “The wholesomeness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
of punishment for the wrongdoer himself is the crown of
Æschylean ethics.”<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> Phidias taught the same lofty truth
through carving the myth of Prometheus Unbound on the
throne of his Olympian Zeus. It spoke, as no other scene
wrought there, of the moral significance of suffering, of divine
mercy and deliverance.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> And Plato’s philosophy accords
with the Æschylean teaching that “Zeus has put in suffering
sovereign instruction.” “Then this must be our notion of the
just man,” he says, “that even when he is in poverty or sickness
or any other seeming misfortune, all things will in the
end work together for good to him in life and death.”<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p>

<p>In this ethical interpretation of the vicissitudes of human
life, of the miscarriage of ambitious plans, the wrecking of
high hopes, the Greek thinkers reached at last the same elevated
point of view that was attained by the great prophets
of the Hebrew race.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The amelioration of war rules and practices</div>

<p>In the ethics of war a similar though less marked development
in moral feeling is traceable. Aside from the relapse
into the practices of savagery under the malign influence of
the Peloponnesian War, there was throughout Greek history
a slow but steady amelioration of the primitive barbarities of
warfare. In the Homeric Age moral feeling had hardly begun
to exercise its influence in humanizing war and in setting
limits to the rights of the conqueror. The Greeks of Homer
were in some respects almost on the level of savages in their
war practices. The life of the captive was in the hands of
his captor, and he might be slain without offense to the common
conscience. Women and children were, as a matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
course, appropriated by the conqueror or sold into slavery.
Homer relates as something to be gloried in, how his hero
Achilles dragged the body of Hector around the walls of
Troy. Such an act of savagery evidently stirred in the poet’s
listeners no feelings of reprobation.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p>In the historical period the mitigation of the barbarities of
war was, after the protection of the sanctuary of Apollo at
Delphi, a chief object of the celebrated Amphictyonic League.
The oath taken by the members of the league included the following
engagement: “We will not destroy any Amphictyonic
town, nor cut it off from running water, in war or in peace.”
This was one of the most noteworthy efforts in antiquity to
lay restraint upon the primitive license of war. Limits are set
to the rights of the conqueror. War begins to have rules.</p>

<p>From the words which Thucydides puts into the mouth of
the Platæans at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War,
we gather that at that time the common sentiment of Hellas
condemned the slaughter of prisoners of war.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> At Athens this
sentiment had found embodiment in the laws, which forbade
the slaying of war captives. But under the demoralizing
influences of the long and bitter struggle between Sparta and
Athens, the little gain which had been made in the humanizing
of war during the preceding centuries was lost. Prisoners
of war were sold into slavery or killed without the least
offense being given to the numbed conscience of Hellas.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a>
Even the terrible massacre, toward the end of the war, of the
four thousand Athenian prisoners at Ægospotami, by the
Spartan Lysander, awakened no protest in Greece at large.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Never has “the moral damage of war” had a more tragic
illustration.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a></p>

<p>During the century following the Peloponnesian War, however,
there seems to have been a positive advance in this
domain. In this period the grosser atrocities of war were in
a measure mitigated by a growing humanitarian sentiment.
But all efforts to humanize war seem to have been limited to
wars between Greek and Greek. From first to last in Greek
history war against barbarians was waged practically without
the least mitigation of its primitive barbarities. It was the
practice of Alexander the Great in his campaigns in Asia to
massacre the men of non-Greek cities taken by assault, and
to sell the women and children as slaves. We hear no protest,
even on the part of the philosophers, against these atrocities
so long as it is non-Greeks who are the victims of them.</p>

<p>But though the efforts of the Greeks to regulate and limit
the rights of the conqueror were confined to wars of Greek
against Greek, still these efforts are significant as a sign of
an awakening ethical sentiment in this domain. This is a
prophecy of a future day, distant though it be, when the
growing conscience of mankind shall have rendered wars
between civilized nations an impossible crime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Efforts to prevent war by arbitration</div>

<p>The common Greek conscience never condemned war in
itself. There never sprang up in Greece an agitation like the
Peace Movement of to-day in Christendom. How deeply ingrained
in the Greek mind was the conviction that war is a
part of the established order of things is shown by the fact
that their treaties ending open hostilities were ordinarily drawn
for a limited term of years. They were merely truces, as
though peace were only an incident in international relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>Even the philosophers regarded a state of war as the normal
and natural relation of Hellenes and barbarians. Aristotle,
as we have seen, taught that barbarians might, without moral
scruple, be hunted like wild animals.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> Plato had no word of
condemnation of war by Greek against non-Greek. But the
Greeks had an uneasy feeling respecting the rightfulness of
war between Greek and Greek; and there came a time when
the best-instructed conscience of Greece positively denounced
wars of this kind. Plato condemned wars between Hellenes
and Hellenes as unnatural.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> This feeling had a kind of
restraining influence upon the Greek cities, and there are
many instances of arbitration in Greek history. Sometimes
a single person of eminence acted as mediator; but oftener
some city or league like the Delphian Amphictyony was
chosen as the arbitrator. In the Hellenistic Age the Roman
Senate frequently undertook the commission of arbitrating
quarrels. The cities concerned were sometimes bound by
oath or by a deposit of money to abide by the decision.
Oftener, however, the decisions rendered, like those by the
Hague Tribunal of to-day, depended for their execution upon
the good will and honor of the states concerned. There are
instances recorded where one or both of the parties refused
to abide by the judgment of the arbitrator.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a></p>

<p>Various motives, it is true, were at work in these arbitration
treaties, but the ethical motive was certainly operative to
a greater or less degree. There was not lacking the feeling,
vague though it may have been, which was later given explicit
expression by Plato, that war between Greek and Greek
was wrong and a crime against Hellenic civilization.</p>

<p>But the most interesting and instructive of all the measures
taken by the Greeks to limit wars among themselves or to
fence them away from a given district was the consecration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
by common consent and agreement, of the land of Elis—wherein
was situated the sacred Olympia—to perpetual peace
and the establishment of a truce of forty days, embracing the
festival period of the Olympian games, during which it was
sacrilegious for one Greek city to make war upon another.
With true vision the philosopher-historian Laurent sees in
the little land of Elis, inviolable as a temple, a prophecy of
the time when the whole earth shall be consecrated to perpetual
peace—an ideal toward which humanity unceasingly
advances.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Socrates and his relation to the moral movement</div>

<p>From no other personage in history, aside from the founders
of universal religions, has there flowed such a stream of
moral influence as issued from the life and teachings of
Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus. All the chief ethical
systems of the Greco-Roman world were the development of
germs found in his doctrines. The Cyrenaic and Eleatic, the
Cynic, Stoic, and Epicurean, the Platonic, Neoplatonic, and
Aristotelian systems had their sources here. The Stoic and
Neoplatonic systems contributed important elements to early
Christian ethics, while the Aristotelian system exercised a
profound influence upon the scholastic ethics of medieval
times. In the contribution which these various systems,
especially the Stoic, have made to the world’s common fund
of ethical thought and feeling is found in large part the
measure of the ethical debt which modern civilization owes
to Hellenism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>Socrates’ aim was to replace the artificial conventional
conscience of his contemporaries by a natural rational conscience;
in other words, to replace customary communal
morality by reflective individual morality.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> His fundamental
doctrine was that virtue is dependent upon knowledge; indeed
he almost or quite made knowledge and virtue one and the
same thing. He maintained that one can no more see the
right without doing it than one can see a proposition to be
true without believing it. Therefore without knowledge—insight—there
can be no true virtue.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a></p>

<p>But clearness of vision requires the purification of the
intellect, the getting rid of all false intellectual and moral
notions; hence the aim and purpose of Socrates’ unique
method of cross-examination was to show his interlocutor the
baseless and mutually contradictory character of his inherited
chance-acquired ideas and beliefs, and to bring him to that
self-knowledge which is the beginning of real knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></p>

<p>This practical identification by Socrates of knowledge and
virtue, this doctrine of his that it is impossible that one
should not will to do that which he sees to be good and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
right, overlooks the saddest and yet most certain fact of human
experience, namely, that perversity of the human will which
causes man though seeing the good to choose the evil. But
it is a theory of human nature which, in the case of such
happily constituted souls as Socrates, in whom the authority
of conscience is sacrosanct and inviolable, is nearly or quite
accordant with fact. With such persons to see an act to be
right is to do it. With them dissonance between knowledge
and volition is a moral impossibility.</p>

<p>Right here, however, a just criticism may be made of the
Socratic philosophy. It is true that without self-knowledge,
without the fulfilling of the Delphian requirement, “Know
thyself,” one cannot be truly moral. But neither Socrates
nor the Greek philosophers in general recognized that this
self-knowledge comes through right living rather than through
right thinking. As Goethe discerningly observes, man comes
to know himself not through reflection but through conduct:
“Do your duty and thou wilt know what thou art.”<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a></p>

<p>And for the common moral life of the world there is a
profound teaching in this Socratic doctrine which makes
knowledge the spring of virtue.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> There is in knowledge,
in insight, in the clear recognition of the relation of man’s
highest good to virtue, an impelling force and authority. As
the world advances in true knowledge, it will advance in true
morality. The Renaissance is ever the precursor of the
Reformation. It is this fact which should make optimists of
us all, for the unceasing advance of the world in knowledge
is well assured.</p>

<p>In the ethical system of Socrates we have a good illustration
of the truth that great men are the product of their
age. With all his originality and profound spiritual insight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
Socrates could not and did not rise much above the plane
of the common moral consciousness of his contemporaries.
He stood on essentially Greek ground. His morality was
the morality of his time and place. In his practical code of
morals he made the Greek virtue of self-control or moderation
a cardinal virtue; he laid the Greek emphasis upon the
civic virtues, dying rather than disobey or evade the decree of
his city; he entertained the common Greek ideas respecting
the family and the domestic virtues; he saw nothing to disapprove
in the life of the hetæra; he viewed the beautiful from
a standpoint wholly Greek, almost identifying beauty with
goodness; he was thoroughly Greek in the aristocratic tendency
of his ethical teachings, making the practice of true
virtue the prerogative of the cultured class alone; he had
the ordinary Greek conscience in regard to slavery; and he
never detached himself from that narrow Greek prejudice
which saw in the Hellenes the elect race. He never proclaimed,
as did many a later Greek and Roman moralist,
the essential unity of the human race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plato and his ethical system</div>

<p>Socrates made virtue and man’s moral nature the subject
of philosophic reflection. His pupil, Plato, systematized his
master’s teachings, and, reducing these and the common
ethical notions of his time to scientific form laid the basis
of the science of ethics.</p>

<p>Plato agreed with Socrates in teaching that to know the
good is necessarily to seek it. He accordingly makes wisdom
the first of the virtues, by wisdom meaning insight, the clear
recognition of what constitutes the highest good. Issuing
from this primary virtue of wisdom, like a stream from a
fountain, are the virtues of courage, temperance, and justice.</p>

<p>From wisdom comes courage, for perfect knowledge of
good and evil casts out fear; and moderation, for knowledge
of higher and lower, of the penalty that awaits all excess,
leads to prudence and self-control; and justice, for knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
of one’s relations to one’s fellows creates consideration for the
rights of others. Plato here simply systematizes and reduces
to scientific form those various virtues which the common
Greek conscience recognized as constituting moral excellence.</p>

<p>Particularly noteworthy is Plato’s doctrine that virtue in
the state is the same as virtue in the individual. There is
need of emphasis being laid anew upon this teaching at the
present time, when the disciples of Machiavelli would give
fresh vogue to the doctrine of a double standard of morality,
one for the individual and another for the state. The modern
world might well sit at Plato’s feet and learn that virtue is
ever one and the same, and that the moral law can no more
be traversed with impunity by a nation than by a single
individual.</p>

<p>In many of his ethical teachings Plato anticipated and
deeply influenced Christian doctrines. He has been called
the precursor of the Fathers of the Church. “His ideas on
virtue,” as Denis observes, “take us far from Greece and
antiquity; they seem addressed rather to the saints and anchorites
than to the citizens of Sparta and Athens.”<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> His
doctrines that the way of approach to God is through contemplation;
that withdrawal from the turmoil of public life
is a furtherance of the true life; that the body is a “prison
house” of the soul; that the soul is immortal and that there
awaits it in the after life recompense for deeds done in the
flesh; that expiation for sin is an ethical necessity; that
punishment is not a deterrent and restraint but a remedy
that restores to health the sin-diseased soul<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a>—all these
ideas and principles were in exact accord with the Christian
moral consciousness, and through St. Augustine and other
Fathers of the Church came to enrich and reënforce the
ethical system of the monastic and the papal Church of the
medieval age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>Perhaps what is the most admirable of Plato’s teachings is
embodied in this petition: “And may I, being of sound
mind, do to others as I would that they should do to me.”<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a>
The significance of this lies in the fact that it is a prayer, and
that the petitioner asks that he may be of sound mind when
he reflects on what he would like to have others do to him.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding the loftiness and nobility of much of
Plato’s ethical thought, still, like Socrates, he stood almost
wholly on Greek ground. His ethics is scarcely more than a
justification of the common Greek morality of his time. He
destroys the family in the interest of the state; he approves
of the exposition of ill-formed, unpromising infants; he
makes morality to be a class thing—only select and cultured
souls are with him capable of genuine virtue. He accepts
slavery as a necessary institution of the state; he practically
shuts out the non-Greek world from the sphere of morality;<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a>
and with the common Greek he believes that to do evil to
one’s enemies is an imperative duty.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> Nor does Plato, like
Hebrew seer, rise high enough above the general Greek
viewpoint to discern the great law of moral progress, and
to prevision the historical goal—ethical world unity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle and his ethics</div>

<p>Aristotle makes Plato’s classification of the virtues the
basis of his well-rounded system of ethics. In one important
respect, however, he differs from Plato; he did not believe
that knowledge of the right necessarily leads to its
practice. He recognized the fact that man though knowing
the good often perversely follows evil.</p>

<p>The great defect of Aristotelian ethics is its failure to rise
to the ethical conception of collective humanity. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
moral inequality of men, which he assumes as the presupposition
of his ethics, he even exaggerated the common Greek
view. He divided men so rigorously into classes with varying
grades of moral capacity that his moral system was ethically
like the caste system of the Indian Brahmans. To affirm
the moral equality of men seemed to him to be a species
of treason against the true humanity, a crime against Greek
civilization.</p>

<p>According to Aristotle the slave was a being so morally different
from the freeman as to constitute practically another
species. He was not wholly incapable of virtue, but could
practice only such servile virtues as obedience and humility.
The last, though a virtue in a slave, was in a freeman an
unworthy weakness.</p>

<p>Barbarians were slaves by nature. Hence it was right for
the Greeks to make war on them and reduce them to slavery,
because “for that end they were born.”<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> Plato had in his
<i>Laws</i> accepted slavery as a political necessity; Aristotle proclaimed
it as a part of the natural order of things. This doctrine
had far-reaching historical consequences. Aristotle’s
declaration that slaves are merely animated instruments, are
men incapable of virtue, worked as powerfully in destroying
ancient slavery as the <i lang="la">obiter dictum</i> of Chief Justice
Taney of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the
Dred Scott case, that negro slaves have no rights which the
white man is bound to respect, worked for the destruction
of negro slavery in the Southern states. For, as Professor
Denis says, by pushing too far the argument, by founding
slavery on natural right, Aristotle provoked thought and
protest, and led the Stoics to reject with indignation his
theories and to proclaim the moral equality of master and
slave, of Greek and barbarian.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>Aristotle’s ethics exercised very little influence either upon
the actual moral life or the ethical speculations of antiquity;
but in the medieval time it came to exert a profound influence
upon Christian ethics.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> The schoolmen made it the
trunk into which they grafted Christian morals—with incongruous
results, as we shall see later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decay of the Greek city state and the accompanying decay of the Greek ideal of character</div>

<p>The political revolution in Hellas in the fourth century
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> had deep import for Greek morality. That century saw
the triumph of Macedonia over the Greek cities. This meant
the triumph of despotic monarchy over city democracy. This
revolution in the political realm meant a great revolution in
the realm of morals, for the reason that, as we have seen,
the old Greek ideal of excellence was largely based upon the
relation of the individual to the state. With the loss of Greek
liberty the very basis of the Greek ideal of character was
removed, and the virtues of the type tended to disappear.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a></p>

<p>In the despotic monarchies of the successors of Alexander
there was little room for the growth and exercise of those
virtues of citizenship which had been nourished in the free
air of the ancient city. The virtues now in vogue and fostered
by the new monarchical régime were no longer those
of the patriot citizen and the patriot warrior, but those of the
pliant subject, the servile courtier, and the mercenary soldier.
In Plutarch’s <i>Lives</i>, out of the twenty heroes and worthies
whom the biographer selected as the noblest representatives
of the virtues most highly esteemed by the Greeks, we find
only two who lived after the general loss of Greek freedom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
and these<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> were men whose characters were formed in the
cities of the Achæan League, in which the ancient liberties
of Hellas were maintained till the rise of the Roman power.
It could not be otherwise, so completely were the fortunes
of the Greek moral ideal bound up with the fortunes of the
Greek city state.</p>

<p>But besides the decay of the free city there were other
causes contributing to the moral decadence which marked
Hellenism in the Alexandrian Age. The close contact of
Greek culture with the corrupt society of the Orient had
disastrous consequences for Greek morality. The principal
courts of the Hellenistic East were plague spots of moral
contagion. The virus of gross sensual immorality was communicated
to Greece, and Greek society was fatally infected.
The Orontes emptied into the Ilissus and the Eurotas, as
later it emptied into the Tiber.</p>

<p>And still another contributing cause of the moral decline
in Hellas was the sudden acquisition of vast individual
and social wealth through the conquest and exploitation of
the East. The morals of no age or people have been proof
against suddenly acquired riches. One explanation of this is
that new and untried sources of pleasure, most often illicit
sensuous pleasure, are opened up, and the temptation to selfish
indulgence is irresistible, coming as it does before self-restraint,
in the face of these unaccustomed solicitations, has
become a habit.</p>

<p>Still another cause of the moral degeneracy of the age, one
which we shall have occasion to speak of more at length a
little further on, is to be sought in the fact that the period
was one of transition in religion as well as in politics and
social relations. Greek morality was, it is true, based in the
main upon the old system of independent city life. Yet Greek
morality was in a way braced by religion and even in part
based upon it. Now in the Alexandrian Age the religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
system of Hellas was undergoing a process of disintegration.
Men were losing faith in their ancestral gods. Philosophic
skepticism was widespread. Inevitably this movement in the
religious realm caused all that part of the moral system dependent
in any degree upon the old religious doctrines and
teachings to weaken and crumble away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethical products of the Hellenistic Age: Stoicism and Epicureanism</div>

<p>There were, however, two ethical products of the Hellenistic
Age which render that period one of the most important of
all epochs in the moral evolution of humanity. These were
Stoicism and Epicureanism. At first blush it may seem
strange that out of the same environment there should arise
two systems of life and thought so strongly contrasted. But
both of these systems are perfectly natural, indeed inevitable,
products of an epoch, such as the Alexandrian Age was, of
transition and moral decadence. In such times strong, self-reliant,
deeply moral natures ever seek refuge in the philosophy
and creed of Zeno, while those of less sturdy faith in
the moral order of the world, of a less strong sense of duty,
turn to the philosophy and creed of Epicurus.</p>

<p>Springing up in Greece as an offshoot of the Socratic philosophy
just after the death of Alexander, Stoicism became the
creed of the select spirits of the age. The crowning virtues
of the moral ideal it held aloft were self-control, imperturbability,
the patient endurance of the ills of life. Amidst the
wreck of worlds one must stand unmoved and erect.</p>

<p>In the very rigid restraint it placed upon the appetites,
passions, and emotions the Stoic ideal of character differed
widely from the ordinary Greek ideal. It approached here
the ascetic type.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> However, in general the Stoic type of character
was closely related to the historic ideal of the Greek
race. The Stoics adopted the fundamental maxim of classical
Greek morality, namely, that man should live conformably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
to nature. They possessed the common Greek consciousness
in the light esteem in which they held the family relations
and duties. They were aristocratic in their moral sympathies
and looked upon the multitude with disdain. They regarded
the gentler virtues, compassion and forgiveness, as weaknesses,
and ranked humility as a virtue only in the slave.</p>

<p>Because of the weak sense of duty possessed in general
by the Greeks, the Stoic ideal of character did not become
a really important factor in the ethical life of the ancient
world till after its adoption by the finer spirits, like Marcus
Aurelius, among the Romans, to whose sense of “the
majesty of duty” the ideal made strong and effective appeal.
It never influenced the masses, but for several centuries
it gave moral support and guidance to the best men of the
Roman race.</p>

<p>Alongside Stoicism grew up Epicureanism, which made
pleasure, not gross sensuous pleasure, but rational refined
enjoyment, the chief good, and hence the pursuit of pleasure
“the highest wisdom and morality.” But this philosophy
made pleasurable feeling dependent upon tranquillity of mind.
To secure this mental repose, one must get rid of fear of
the gods and of death. These ignoble and disquieting fears
Epicurus and his disciples sought to banish by teaching that
the gods do not concern themselves with human affairs, and
that death ends all for man.</p>

<p>Epicureanism in its moral code was at one with the common
Greek consciousness in making moderation or prudence
a cardinal virtue;<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> but it differed radically from the ordinary
Greek mode of thought in its depreciation and neglect of the
civic virtues. Hence the system was at once a symptom and
a cause of the decay of the Greek city state and of the old
moral ideal which was based so largely upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>

<p>The philosophy of Epicurus, as we have already said, is
the natural product of an age of transition and social dislocation.
It offers an ideal of life which is eagerly adopted by
those unable to combat trouble, by those to whom duty does
not appeal as something dignified and majestic. Hence in
the decadent and unsettled age of the Roman Empire it
became the rule of life of large numbers of the cultured
classes of society, and must be regarded as one of the disintegrating
agencies of Greco-Roman civilization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advance in humanitarian feelings and growth in ethical cosmopolitanism</div>

<p>A general view of the society of the Hellenistic world
toward the opening of the Christian era discloses the fact
that the moral evolution so long in progress has effected
such changes in the Greek moral consciousness as to render
this ethical movement an important preparation for the incoming
of the moral ideal of Christianity. These changes
are especially to be observed in the growth of humanitarian
sentiment and in a broadening of the moral sympathies.</p>

<p>The Greeks, compared with the Romans, were naturally a
humane folk. When it was proposed to introduce at Athens
the gladiatorial games, the orator Demonax told the people
that they should first tear down the ancestral altar to Pity, a
shrine which, in the words of Lecky, “was venerated throughout
the ancient world as the first great assertion among mankind
of the supreme sanctity of mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> One of the motives
of Pythagoras in forbidding the use of meat as food was, seemingly,
to inspire a horror of shedding blood, even that of an
animal. The laws of Athens permitted no punishment more
severe than a painless death.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a></p>

<p>This natural humaneness of the Greek spirit deepened as
the centuries passed. Contrasted with the Periclean Age the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Platonic Age shows, Professor Mahaffy affirms, “a greater
gentleness and softness, ... a nearer approach to the greater
humanity of Christian teaching.”<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> We have already noted
this movement in the domain of war practices and customs,
where it found expression in the amelioration of the gross,
archaic barbarities of primitive warfare. In the social sphere
the progressive evolution is evidenced by the growing mildness
of slavery and the frequency of the manumission of
slaves.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></p>

<p>The broadening movement ran parallel with the humanitarian.
Classical Greek morality, as we have seen, was narrow
and racial. Now one of the most important facts in the moral
evolution of Hellas was the broadening of the moral sympathies,
especially during the three centuries immediately preceding
our era. This development is connected closely with
the great expansion movement which followed the conquests
of Alexander and which resulted in the Hellenization of the
East. Everywhere the Greeks came in close contact with
various peoples upon whom they had been accustomed to
look with aversion or disdain. Ancient prejudices were dispelled,
race barriers were leveled, and the moral sympathies
overspread wide areas from which they had hitherto been
excluded by ignorance and race egotism.</p>

<p>It would doubtless be unhistorical to represent this movement
as anything more than a tendency—a dawning recognition
by select spirits of the ethical kinship of all men, and
the coextension of the moral law with the human race. It
may, however, rightly be compared with that broadening of
the moral feelings which we have traced among the people
of Israel, and which resulted in a morality at first as narrow
and exclusive as that of the Greeks, widening at last into the
ethical universalism of the great teachers of the nation.</p>

<p>The widening movement was represented, and was given
its chief impetus, by the Stoics. The Stoic ideal of character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
differed from the ordinary Greek ideal especially in its
cosmopolitanism. Influenced by the spirit of the age in
which it had birth, it ignored the old distinction between
Greek and non-Greek and proclaimed the essential brotherhood
of man.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> The Stoic regarded the world and not his
native city as his fatherland. The Cynics, whom we may
regard as extreme Stoics, looked upon city patriotism as a
narrow prejudice and refused to give love of one’s city a
place among the virtues. Just as the Greek age was merging
into the Greco-Roman the broadening movement found its
noblest representative in Plutarch, “the last of the Greeks.”<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a>
His chief characteristics were his broad interests and his universal
moral sympathies. He had moved far away from the
common Greek standpoint. He had emancipated himself
from the tyranny of the common Greek prejudices. Under
the influences of his time he had become a cosmopolitan. To
him the Greek was no longer an elect race. His moral sympathies
embraced all mankind. His was almost a Christian
conscience, save as to the purely theological virtues.</p>

<p>This enlargement of the intellectual and moral outlook of
the Greek world presaged the dawn of a new epoch in the
moral evolution of humanity. It made easier for many the acceptance
of the Gospel teachings of human brotherhood and
universal love. Christian ethics was largely debtor to the
cosmopolitan spirit of Greek culture, especially as embodied
in the Stoic ideal of moral excellence.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>To trace further this moral development in the ancient
world we must now turn from following its course among
the Greeks to follow it among that kindred people, the
Romans, who, through the political unification of the world,
reënforced this growing universalism in the moral domain,
and thereby reached that ethical conception of collective humanity
which Israel had reached through spiritual intuition,
and Hellas through philosophical reflection and widening
culture.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></p>

<span class="subhead">ROMAN MORALS: AN IDEAL OF CIVIC DUTY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_212a">I. <span class="smcap">Institutions and Conditions of Life Determining
the Early Moral Type</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Roman family: ancestor worship and the <i lang="la">patria potestas</i></div>

<p>The family in early Rome may more unreservedly be pronounced
a seed plot of morals than in the case of any other
ancient people save the Chinese. It was ancestor worship
which made it such a nursery of morality, for the cult of ancestors
made the family a group of co-worshipers about the
domestic hearth. This worship purified and braced morality,
since the tutelary spirits were believed to watch over the
morals of the family and to punish wrongdoing. No impure
act could be committed in the presence of the chaste
hearth fire, and no one guilty of unexpiated crime dared
to come into its presence.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></p>

<p>But it was in constituting the father the high priest of the
family group that this domestic worship exercised its greatest
influence upon early Roman morality. It gave a religious
sanction to the father’s authority and made the <i lang="la">patria potestas</i>
for many centuries a molding force in the moral life of the
Roman people.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> A little further on we shall see how, in
the atmosphere of the home thus constituted, was fostered
in the youth the virtues of submission to rightful authority,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
respect for law, and obedience to magistrates—virtues which
were one secret of the strength and triumphs of early Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The city state</div>

<p>Next after the family the state was the most important
agency in the creation of the Roman type of virtue. We
have to do here, as in Greece, with the city state. This was
the chief sphere of duty of the Roman during his mature and
active life. Consequently, just as it was the nature of the
city state which in Greece determined in large measure what
should constitute the supreme virtues and duties of the Greek
ideal of character, so was it the constitution of Rome as a city
state that, as we shall see a little later, determined what
should be the leading virtues and duties entering into the
Roman ideal of goodness. This made that ideal to be preëminently
an ideal of civic duty. “Never since the fall of
paganism have the civic virtues shone out so brilliantly.”<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The occupations of farming and war</div>

<p>Alongside domestic and political institutions stands, as we
have seen, occupation as a creator and molder of the moral
type of a people. The two occupations of the early Latins
were farming and war, and thus it came about that in the
primitive ethical type were united the sturdy moral qualities
of the peasant farmer and the heroic virtues of the warrior.
This blend produced one of the most admirable moral types
of the ancient world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The religion</div>

<p>Aside from the cult of ancestors, religion among the
Romans exercised but little direct influence upon morality,
for the reason that it was mainly a method of obtaining
prosperity, of averting calamity, and of reading the future.
There was in truth an almost complete separation of religion
and morality. It was only in later times that the Roman
philosophers sought in the moral character of the gods
models for human imitation. But though religion had so
little to do in creating the salient virtues of the moral type,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
it did reënforce the sentiment of patriotism, since the temple
was a state institution, and in various other ways—as,
for instance, in lending sanctity to oaths—quickened and
strengthened the sense of obligation and duty.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_214">II. <span class="smcap">The Primitive Moral Type</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The ethics of the family; the virtue of obedience</div>

<p>In the bosom of the family was nourished what we may
regard as the primal virtue of the Latin race—submission
to authority.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> The son’s subjection to the father’s authority
was complete throughout his whole existence. He could not
disobey his father’s command. More than seven centuries
after the founding of Rome the Emperor Tiberius absolved
a certain person from guilt in participating in a revolt,
because it was shown that he had acted under the orders
of his father.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a></p>

<p>This virtue of submission to rightful authority, of obedience
to superiors, contributed much to the military efficiency of
the Roman people. Indeed, it lay at the basis of their greatness
in war. The consul’s authority in the field was like that
of the father in the family, and obedience in the soldier was
a habit, almost a religious instinct. Thus did this virtue,
which had its starting point in the family, help largely to
give the Romans the rule of the world.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Civic and military virtues</div>

<p>Patriotism, meaning submission, obedience, devotion to
the state, was the saving virtue in the Roman ideal of
excellence. “Patriot” and “good man” were identical terms.
“Dear to us are our parents,” says Cicero, “dear our children,
our kindred and our friends; but one’s country alone
includes all our loves, for what good man would hesitate
to die if he could promote her welfare.”<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a></p>

<p>Since war was the normal status of society in ancient
times, the moral qualities of the Roman as of the Greek
patriot were the virtues of the soldier—obedience, courage,
and self-devotion in battle. And by no people, save perhaps
the Japanese as shown in their recent history, has the
soldierly virtue of self-renunciation for the fatherland been
more exalted or more finely exemplified than by the Romans
in early times.</p>

<p>In this ready self-devotion of the Roman hero to public
interests we have an exhibition of the altruistic sentiment
in its loftiest form, for of all forms of disinterested action,
as Lecky maintains, the self-abnegation of the ancient warrior
for his city was the most unselfish, for the reason
that he made the sacrifice without any hope of reward in
another life.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The industrial virtues</div>

<p>In early Rome there was no such prejudice against labor
as unworthy and morally degrading as we meet with at a later
period. The fact that a large body of the citizens in primitive
Rome were peasant farmers determined that the traditional
virtues of this class should find a high place in the early
national ideal of character. The moral or semi-moral qualities
of the peasant, namely, simplicity, frugality, industry, and
conservatism or respect for the past, formed the substratum
of early Roman morality. It was from the primitive citizen
peasantry that came the strong, tough, moral fiber of the old
Roman character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious duties</div>

<p>In dealing with the subject of the relation of the Roman
religion to morality we may speak of religious duties but
hardly of religious virtues, and for the reason that the aim
of religion was the safety and welfare of the state. Neglect
of the temple rites and sacrifices was believed to anger
the gods, who would in their resentment bring terrible trouble
and misfortune upon the nation—for the Romans never
outgrew the conception of collective responsibility. Hence
the careful performance of religious duties was a phase of
patriotism. Neglect of these duties was antisocial conduct.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a></p>

<p>In the performance of his religious duties the Roman conceived
that all that was necessary was to do the right thing,
to perform the right act, or repeat correctly the right formula;
the disposition of mind and state of heart made no difference
with the result. Man’s relations to deity were assimilated
to his relations to nature. To secure a given result in the
physical world, man needs only to do the right thing, as, for
instance, to drop the seed into the ground at the right season
and the harvest follows without any regard to the state of
mind or heart of the person performing the act. This was
the Roman’s conception of his relation to the gods. Hence
religion and morality were practically separated. Religion
failed to supply motives for moral action, except in so far as
it reënforced the sentiment of patriotism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defects of the type: (<i>a</i>) its aristocratic character</div>

<p>From the foregoing brief notice of some of the chief expressions
of the moral consciousness of the early Romans we
cannot fail to recognize that their ideal of character was in
many respects a very admirable one. Its realization in actual
flesh and blood gives us those heroic characters which will
live forever in Roman legend, and alongside the Greek heroes
in the pages of Plutarch. It molded men grave, earnest, and
austere, reverent toward superiors, patriotic and self-devoted
to the common good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>But the ideal had great defects. One of the most conspicuous
of these was its aristocratic character. Rome, writes
Wedgwood, “accepts consistently and logically the aristocratic
theory on which ancient society is based, and carries out
the ideal of the Old World in all its naked impressiveness.”<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a>
Though advancing far during a thousand years of eventful
history toward ethical universalism, pagan Rome never actually
reached this moral goal. She never recognized in practice
the moral equality of all men. There were to the very
last in the pagan Empire, classes, such as slaves and gladiators,
who were practically outside the moral sphere. Even
Roman Stoicism, which was the latest and noblest expression
of the moral life of Rome, notwithstanding its cosmopolitan
tendencies, was essentially aristocratic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) Its omission of the gentler and the intellectual virtues</div>

<p>Another defect of the old Roman type of excellence was
its exclusion of the gentler virtues—humility, tenderness,
and sympathy with suffering. The type of character fostered
by the ideal was hard and severe, even callous and cruel,
proud and self-assertive. It was a type somewhat like the
Spartan, one which, when the age of reflection came, naturally
developed into the Stoic. The old Romans lacked the quality
of mercy and compassion for weakness. They seemed almost
destitute of the sentiment of pity for misfortune. Their
treatment of prisoners of war and of their slaves in the
later period was marked by a repellent brutality. The place
in their amusements which the gladiatorial combats assumed
evidences their callous insensibility to suffering.</p>

<p>Still another defect of this ideal was that it gave little or no
place to the intellectual virtues. These ethical qualities which
were assigned so prominent a place in the Greek type of excellence,
and which since the Renaissance the Western world
has come to esteem so highly, were never greatly valued by
the Romans until they came under the influence of Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
culture, and then only by the few; hence their intellectual
life was, in general, lacking in moral impulse. Mental self-culture
was not with them, as it was with the Greeks and is
coming to be with ourselves, a moral requirement.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_218">III. <span class="smcap">The Moral Evolution under the Republic</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The maintenance of the standard in early times</div>

<p>The four essential facts in the moral life of Rome as a
republic are: first, the high standard maintained in the early
period; second, the gradual widening of the moral sympathies
through the influence of conquest and advance in civilization;
third, the general decline in morals during the two centuries
preceding the establishment of the Empire; and fourth, the
modification of the moral type through contact with Greece
and the Orient.</p>

<p>Through the legendary haze which envelops all the earlier
centuries of Rome, the one fact which stands out with comparative
clearness is the Spartan-like loyalty of the old Roman
to the ideal of character which he had conceived as the noblest
and best. The legends of this period, invented or repeated
by the men of a later age, celebrate qualities of character
which we may believe really marked early Roman life and
thought. Among these virtues were patriotic altruism, absolute
self-abnegation for the common good, as illustrated by
such tales as those of the self-devotion for the Roman people
of Curtius and of the Elder and Younger Publius Decius
Mus; reverence for law, as shown by the consul Lucius
Junius Brutus in the condemnation of his sons to death for
taking part in a conspiracy; and incorruptible integrity, as
illustrated by the tales of Fabricius.</p>

<p>Even though all these stories of the heroic age of Rome
be the invention of a later time, they at least show what at
this later (though still comparatively early) period were highly
esteemed qualities of character, just as the stories celebrating
the filial piety of Chinese heroes of the olden time show how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
high a place this moral trait held in the ideal of the age that
invented or repeated these tales with a didactic purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The widening of the moral sympathies</div>

<p>The gradual broadening of the moral sympathies was a
very important phase of the moral evolution in Roman
society up to the end of the Republic. These sympathies
embraced at first hardly more than the patrician class, which
formed the nucleus of the early Roman community. The
enlarging of the area covered by the ethical feelings was
simply one phase, and, from the viewpoint of the student of
morals, the most important phase of that political evolution
which in the course of centuries brought within the sacred
pale of Roman citizenship first the Plebeians, then the Latins,
next the Italians, and finally all the freemen of the extended
Roman dominions. That is to say, this central fact in Roman
history, the expansion of the city into the world state, was in
its deepest significance, in its remote consequences, as much
a moral as a political movement. Conquest, it is true, prepared
the way for the revolution, and the concessions made
by the ruling class to the demands of the disfranchised classes
and peoples were motived in the main by political prudence
and expediency. But it is equally true that ethical sentiment
worked with these other causes in determining the course
and progress of the revolution, and that one of its most
important results was the imparting of a great impulse to
the widening moral movement going on in the ancient
world, and the bringing to recognition of the principles of
the moral equality and brotherhood of men.</p>

<p>This great all-embracing movement in the Roman world
can, we believe, best be understood in its significance for the
moral evolution of mankind only when translated into terms
of the similar movement in modern times. We recognize the
moral character, in a final analysis, of the revolution which,
during the past century, has by successive enfranchisements
admitted to a share in government and to the enjoyment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
political rights the masses in modern civilized states. The
movement has been largely ethical in its causes and still more
largely ethical in its effects. The struggle of the people has
had for aim to do away with unjust privilege and to establish
equality and justice. The most important permanent effects
of the revolution are indisputably to be looked for in the moral
sphere. The incoming of democracy, meaning as it does the
investing of the individual with dignity and worth, means
the ennobling of the moral life of the world. It is this that
constitutes the real significance of the democratic revolution
and which gives it its important place in the moral history
of humanity.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a></p>

<p>The same is true of that phase of the modern movement
which looks toward the formation of the world state. The
forces at work here are admittedly varied and complex, but
prominent among these agencies are the ethical. It is the
broadening of the moral sympathies, the development of
a true cosmopolitanism, a deepening consciousness of the
brotherhood of men, the growth of a new social and international
conscience—it is this slow evolution in the moral realm
that has laid or is laying the true basis of the future world
union. The universal state, once created,—this need not
be argued,—would inevitably react powerfully and favorably
upon the moral feelings and sympathies of men.</p>

<p>It was the same in the ancient world. The admission to
full Roman citizenship, through successive enfranchisements,
of all the freemen of the Roman dominions was at once the
sign and the cause of a vast moral development. As fellow
citizens with equal rights and privileges, men came to know
and feel their ethical kinship. Likewise the establishment of
the world state registered a great moral advance and supplied
the conditions of a still greater progress. Had not the moral
forces worked with the Roman legions, the world union could
never have been formed, or, at least, if once formed, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
never have been maintained for the long period that it was.
It is probably true that the bringing by Rome of such a wide
reach of lands under her rule did as much to awaken the sense
of the brotherhood of man as did the teachings of Hebrew
prophet or the culture and philosophy of Greece. It was
certainly the political union of the civilized world that helped
to awaken in Cicero and in the later philosophers of the
Empire the conviction that the reach of the moral sympathies
should be as extended as the human race. Thus the
wide empire created by Rome was a potent influence making
for ethical universalism. Never since the unification of the
ancient world by Rome have the moral feelings of men been
quite so narrow as before; never since has the conception
of human brotherhood, the ideal of a united world, seemed
so entirely a dream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of the decline in morals under the later Republic: (<i>a</i>) the passing of the city state</div>

<p>Notwithstanding this broadening movement in the moral
domain, the last century of the Republic was marked by a
great lowering of the earlier high moral standard and by a
loss of some of the chief virtues of the primitive Roman
type. There were many causes contributing to this moral
degeneracy. Among these was the decay of institutions
that had created or fostered the primitive moral type, and
the growth of others, such as slavery and the gladiatorial
games, which exercised a pernicious influence upon morality.
Besides causes of this nature there were others which were
the natural outcome of the career of conquest the Romans
had led. The conquest of the world had imported into the
Roman political and social system many alien elements unfavorable
to morality, and had brought Roman civilization, on one
side, into hurtful contact with the older and morally corrupt
cultures of the Orient. In what follows we shall speak in
some detail of the more important of these agencies, which
in the later preimperial period undermined the originally
sound morality of the Roman people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p>A first cause of the moral deterioration was the decay of
the city constitution. We have seen that the free city state
was the chief nursery of those patriotic virtues which constituted
the cardinal moral qualities of the Roman ideal of
character. But by the beginning of the last century preceding
the Christian era various causes, chiefly, however, the mere
widening of the Roman territory through conquest, had undermined
the political institutions of Rome and had converted
into mobs of the proletariat the public assemblies of citizens.
The original constitution of the city had become an empty
form, and the way had been paved for the setting up of
monarchical government.</p>

<p>With the passing of the city state those civic patriotic
virtues which the discipline of the democratic city constitution
had trained and developed, disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> As the Christian
Church, which was destined in the fullness of time to
take the place of the city in the minds and hearts of men
and become the object and inspirer of moral enthusiasm, had
not yet come in with its new ideal of virtue, there ensued a
sort of moral interregnum, such as usually marks transition
periods in the history of states and races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) The economic decay of the rural class</div>

<p>A second cause of the moral decline is to be found in
the decay of the Italian peasantry. This economic revolution
had its real starting point in the Hannibalic War. That protracted
struggle, carried on largely in Italy itself, practically
ruined the peasant class in many districts, and their little
farms were absorbed by the growing estates of the great
landholders—those <i lang="la">latifundia</i> which Pliny later declared to
have been the ruin of Italy.</p>

<p>The practical disappearance of the Italian peasant farmer
meant the disappearance of those simple robust virtues, bred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
in thousands of homes of the countryside, like the little
Sabine farm of the Elder Cato, which had contributed so
largely to determine the type of Roman character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) Growth of the slave system</div>

<p>The decay of the Italian peasantry was accompanied by
the development of the slave system, so that at the same
time that the peasant home, a nursery of sterling if crude
virtues, was being destroyed, the slave estate with its chain
gangs and its ergastula, a very hotbed of degrading vices,
was being created. Of all the institutions that contributed to
the moral degradation of the later Republic, slavery as it
developed here must be assigned the first place of evil preëminence.
Its effects were equally debasing upon the master,
the slave, and the poor farmer. It tended to render more
callous and cruel the spirit of the master,<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> to destroy the
moral character of the slave, to undermine family morals,<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a>
and, by placing a stigma upon labor, to degrade the free
laborer. Thus did the institution tend to develop in different
classes of the population feelings, sentiments, and a disposition
of mind wholly unfavorable to the existence or the
development of a sound moral life in society at large.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>d</i>) The disesteem of the industrial virtues</div>

<p>In placing a stigma upon labor, slavery did not create a
new prejudice, but merely intensified and made more inclusive
a prejudice already existing. As we have seen, there
existed in classical antiquity a deep-rooted feeling against
manual labor as morally unworthy of a freeman. Agriculture
was the only occupation which escaped this general condemnation,
and which was regarded as becoming a gentleman.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
Cicero declares all mechanical laborers to be by virtue of
their profession mean, the gains of hired workmen to be ungenteel,
and says that all retailers of merchandise should be
despised.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> Even buying and selling on a large scale did
not entirely escape the taint of retail merchandizing; it was
merely a little less despicable.</p>

<p>This general contempt for the occupations of the artisan
and merchant rendered impossible the development of industrial
virtues in the Roman masses. Torn from the soil and
swept into the cities by the movement cityward in this period,
the free poor, too proud to engage in occupations which were
looked upon as degrading, were stranded in idleness and exposed
to all the demoralizing influences of city life. Crowds
of them became the dependents of the rich and formed that
despicable client class of the later Republic and the early Empire
whose abominable vices roused the anger and provoked
the scorn of the satirists and moralists of the time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>e</i>) Free distribution of corn</div>

<p>A direct outgrowth of the presence in Rome of this great
multitude of the idle free poor was the evil of the corn laws.
The indiscriminate public free distribution of corn to the
poorer citizens—prompted, for the most part, not by genuine
humanitarian feelings but by unworthy political and personal
motives—had a most debauching effect upon morals.
It intensified the very evil it was supposed to ameliorate.
It attracted still greater crowds of the idle to the capital,
depressed to a still greater degree agriculture in Italy,—grain
for distribution being imported in the main from Egypt and
North Africa,—and checked every tendency toward the formation
of habits of industry, self-reliance, and thrift in the
lower classes. The evil attained its climax when the largesses
became an undisguised bid by the corrupt demagogue for
popular favor—the naked price paid by rich plotters against
the commonwealth for the support of the morally debauched
and fickle proletariat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>f</i>) Gladiatorial games</div>

<p>The idle population of Rome had not only to be fed but
to be amused. The same motives that had led to the enormous
increase in the largesses of grain to the free poor
contributed also to the multiplication of the spectacles of the
circus and the amphitheater, particularly of the gladiatorial
games, which, introduced at Rome in the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
had now become the favorite amusement of the Roman
populace. “That not only men, but women in an advanced
period of civilization,—men and women who not only professed
but very frequently acted upon a high code of morals,—should
have made the carnage of men their habitual
amusement, that all this should have continued for centuries,
with scarcely a protest, is one of the most startling facts in
moral history.”<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a></p>

<p>But this fact is by no means an isolated or unique one in
the ethical history of mankind. The student of the history of
morals is often brought face to face with similar facts in the
annals of every race and of every age. The fact with which
the moralist is here confronted is hardly more startling than
the hideously barbarous treatment of their enemies by the
deeply pious Jews; the heartless massacre at times of their
prisoners by the naturally humane Greeks; the savage severity
of the medieval inquisitors toward heretics, while in general
showing the greatest compassion and sympathy for those in
pain and distress; the atrocious cruelty of the punishments
meted out to offenders against society by the Christian governments
of Europe down almost to the last century; the
callous insensibility, until just now, of modern society to “the
bitter cry of the children” of its city slums; and, above all,
the glorification of war by the professed followers of Him
whose most distinctive title is the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p>But just as all these startling inconsistencies and aberrations
in moral conduct may be explained, in part at least, by
reference to the effect upon the moral sympathies of tribal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
religion, of political rancor and fanaticism, of false theological
dogmas, and of bad bequests of practices and conventions
unreflectingly adopted by an advanced civilization
from ages of barbarism and savagery, so is it possible in the
same way to explain and render in a measure comprehensible
to ourselves the existence without protest among the comparatively
cultured Romans of such an institution as that of
the gladiatorial combats. The system was fostered by slavery
and the Romans’ occupation of war. The Roman people
were originally stern and just; slavery and war tended to
make them hard and callous. Slavery created a sort of caste
morality, which excluded from the moral sphere large classes
as completely as though they belonged to the dumb-animal
creation. It was these pariah classes that contributed a large
portion of the victims of the cruel sport. The enormous
quantities of human flesh and blood required to nourish the
system could have been found in no society except in one
where a considerable part of the population had been degraded
to a mere animal plane of existence and thus put
practically beyond the range and reach of the moral feelings.</p>

<p>Like slavery, the constant wars in which the Romans
were engaged tended to indurate their feelings and to destroy
all sense of the sanctity of human life. In what way
the military life of the Romans reacted upon their feelings and
sentiments and molded even their ethical theories is shown
by the fact that the Roman moral philosophers in general
defended and approved the combats of the amphitheater on
the ground that they inured the soldier to the sight of blood
and taught him contempt of death.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a></p>

<p>The effect of these inhuman spectacles upon morality was
most lamentable. They hindered the growth of humane feelings
in the men, deadened every tender sensibility of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
women, habituated the young to scenes of cruelty,<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> and
developed finally the normal impassiveness of the Roman
temperament into a fierce delight in human suffering.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>g</i>) Decay of religious faith</div>

<p>The influence of religion upon Roman morality was never
great; still, as we have seen, the Roman’s sense of duty was
in some degree strengthened by his belief in the gods and
in their general watch over the conduct of men. Hence that
growth of philosophic doubt among the learned class which
characterized the later period of the Republic, and the transformation
of religion into gross superstition among the debased
population of the cities, contributed to hasten and render more
decisive the moral decline we are tracing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>h</i>) Extremes of wealth and poverty</div>

<p>The apparent teaching of history is that there is an antithesis
between wealth and morality. It is a commonplace of the
records of civilization that as a community has advanced in
material prosperity and waxed rich it has gone backward in
morals. The growth in great riches of a people has usually
been the prelude to their moral degeneracy and loss of
place in the competition of races and cultures.</p>

<p>There ought certainly to be no antithesis between riches
and morality, any more than between intellectual culture and
morality. To suppose that there is any natural and necessary
incompatibility between these two elements of civilization
is to suppose that there exists a fatal antinomy at the very
heart of the cosmic evolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>That moral degeneracy should be the common accompaniment
of a community’s growth in wealth, springs not from
the mere possession of wealth, but in the main from its
inequitable distribution. Thus far in history, as a society has
grown in riches it has become divided into two sharply contrasted
classes, the very rich and the very poor. Now each of
these extremes is unfavorable to morality. Excessive fortune
gives birth to luxury, to gross, extravagant, and unethical
uses of wealth. Particularly is this likely to be true if the
elevation to affluence has been sudden and from comparative
poverty. The reason of this is, as was long ago pointed out,
that men before they have learned self-control have placed
in their hands means for the unlimited satisfaction of every
appetite and desire, and generally the desire of such men
is for indulgence in gross sensuous and sensual forms of
pleasure. On the other hand, extreme poverty is equally
disastrous to morals; for poverty means almost inevitably
undue nutrition of body and soul, and generally squalid and
insanitary conditions of life that destroy at once physical
and moral health, and breed in the young and old alike the
most repellent and contagious forms of vice.</p>

<p>Now while at every period of Roman history we find
two classes, the rich and the poor, the extremes of wealth
and poverty do not appear until about a century before
the establishment of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> And unfortunately all the
conditions which tend to render such inequality of fortune
especially pernicious to morals were existent at this time
in Roman society. The men into whose control came the
great fortunes of the period were generally men of servile
origin, because law and public sentiment prevented the senatorial
order from engaging in trade or commerce. These
men, who had not yet outgrown the grossness and vices of
the slave class from which they had sprung, with unlimited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
wealth at their command, and “without the restraint of traditions
or ideals,” were naturally prone to indulge in vulgar luxury,
in ostentatious extravagance, and in orgies of sensuality.</p>

<p>At the same time at the other end of the social scale
were the very poor, subjected to the debasing influences of
idleness, of a grossly immoral stage, and of the brutalizing
spectacles of the amphitheater. The relations of the large
number of propertyless clients to their wealthy patrons bred
in this class the hateful vices of servility and hypocrisy.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a></p>

<p>Thus the division of Roman society into two classes, the
overrich and the very poor,—a division which is always the
sign and register of social maladjustment and injustice,—became
one of the most potent causes of that moral degeneracy
which relaxed the fiber of the Roman race and preluded
the downfall of the Republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>i</i>) Demoralizing influence of Eastern luxury and vice</div>

<p>After the conquest of the East the national character of
the Romans was subjected to a great variety of influences
from Greece and the half-Hellenized countries of the Orient.
Many of these influences, as we shall notice a little later,
had a strengthening and uplifting effect upon Roman life,
especially in the upper circles of society, but in general the
new elements now imported into Roman civilization from
the Hellenistic East were hurtful to morals. Rome “sucked
poison from the Attic bloom decayed.”</p>

<p>It is a commonplace of history that at the time of the
Roman conquest of the East the great semi-Hellenized cities
of the Orient were sinks of moral corruption. Brought into
close contact with these morally debased communities, Roman
civilization was at once infected with the fatal virus. Streams
of impurity overflowed every country of the once moral West.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
The Orontes emptied into the Tiber. Oriental vices and
luxury came in as a flood. The primitive Roman virtues
of frugality and simplicity disappeared. Greek cooks, we are
told, brought a higher price than Greek philosophers.</p>

<p>Almost every element of the Greco-Oriental culture seemed
to bear within it the seeds of moral deterioration and decay.
Greek philosophy, pervaded in general by a spirit of skepticism,
tended to unsettle still more positively the already
shaken faith of the Romans in their ancestral gods. Roman
morality, in so far as it was supported by religious belief,
was thus fatally impaired. The Epicurean philosophy, if not—as
taught by most of the Sophists—a direct incentive to
vice, afforded at least a ready apology for indulgence in
coarse and gluttonous pleasures.</p>

<p>The plays presented on the Roman comic stage were mostly
pieces of the Greek drama, which, in the process of adaptation
to a Roman audience, had been made coarse and dissolute.
Thus the theater became one of the most effective agencies
of social corruption. In the words of Mommsen, it was “the
great school at once of Hellenism and of vice.”<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Modifications in the moral type itself</div>

<p>A much more important fact in the moral history of the
later Republic than this lowering of the standard of conduct
is the change which was being effected in the moral ideal
itself. While certain causes were at work depressing the
moral standard to the lowest point, perhaps, that it ever
touched in the long history of Rome, there were other causes
in operation which were slowly modifying the old Roman type
of character and creating a new type made up largely of new
virtues. We speak of this change in the ideal as a fact of
greater significance than that of moral degeneracy, for the
reason that a decline in actual morality, the failure of a people
to live up to the best they know, is always a superficial and
transient phenomenon compared with the changes effected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
by different influences in the moral type itself, since these
changes constitute the very essence of the ethical evolution.</p>

<p>The causes at work modifying the old Roman ideal of
character were various; but more vital than all other influences
were those that came through the contact of Rome with
Greek culture and the civilizations of the Orient. At the heart
of these ancient cultures were ethical elements of inestimable
value. Among these were the Greek humanitarian spirit and
the various intellectual virtues which characterized the Greek
type of excellence; and, in the Oriental theosophic cultures,
a deeply religious spirit and the religious virtues which marked
the moral ideals of the Eastern nations, particularly the Egyptian,
the Persian, and the Hebrew. We recognize the supreme
importance for the later moral history of Rome, as well as for
that of the whole Western world, of the ethical products of
the religious culture of Judea, but we do not recognize as fully
the importance of the ethical elements of the secular culture
of Greece and of the theosophic civilizations of Egypt and
Persia. But Rome’s ethical debt to these older cultures was
also indisputably great.</p>

<p>But since these Greco-Oriental influences which were
at work modifying the old Roman type of character had
not wrought their full effects before the close of the third
century of the imperial period, we shall reserve further comment
on them, and on the new composite type they were
contributing to create, for the next division of this chapter,
in which we shall follow the trend of the moral evolution
under the pagan Empire.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_231">IV. <span class="smcap">The Moral Evolution under the Pagan Empire</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The bad bequest</div>

<p>Roman society throughout the first century of the pagan
Empire, as mirrored in the literature of the period, presents
a picture of frightful moral degeneracy. This state of things
was largely an inheritance from the Republic. It was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
continuation of that moral decline which began in the second
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and some of the contributing causes of which,
such as slavery, the spectacles of the amphitheater, the free
distribution of corn, together with contact with the dissolute
civilizations of the Orient, were considered briefly in the preceding
pages. Since all these causes of moral degradation
were still at work in the society of the early Empire, and as
fresh agencies of malign influence were added to them, it was
inevitable that the moral anarchy should not only continue
but should grow worse.</p>

<p>The definitive establishment of the Empire and the passing
of the liberal institutions of the Republic changed wholly the
atmosphere in which had been nourished the virtues of Republican
Rome. Political liberty was dead, and all true civic
activity, which had been the very breath of life to the citizen
of the ancient city, had come to an end. In the new world
that was forming there was no room for the exercise of those
patriotic virtues which had made the early history of Rome
so great, and had given her the rule of the world.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a></p>

<p>One wholly fresh cause of moral debasement was the personal
character of several of the occupants of the imperial
throne during the first century of the Empire. The Oriental
extravagancies and coarse debaucheries which disgraced the
court of a Claudius, a Caligula, or a Nero, communicated their
virus to every part of the social body. Never did the proverb,
“As court, so people,” have such justification. At the same
time the tyranny which marked the rule of more than one of
the emperors instituted a demoralizing terror like that of the
proscriptions of the Civil Wars. Under the influence of the
frightful persecutions of their order, the senatorial aristocracy,
with moral fiber now relaxed and corroded by effeminate
luxury, lost seemingly all those virtues which earlier had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
characterized their class, and was transformed into a body at
times sycophantic, cringing, and base almost beyond belief.
But it is doubtful if any other aristocracy which history has
known would have stood the test any better. The French
nobility of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, excluded
from participation in political affairs by the divine-right monarchy,
and made servile dependents of the court, exhibited
almost as depressing a spectacle of moral degeneracy as did
the higher Roman classes under the more frightful tyranny
of the early Cæsars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The old and the new</div>

<p>But we may here profitably call to mind the words of Wedgwood
to the effect that the phenomenon of moral decay, although
the most striking, is not the most significant fact in
the moral history of a race or of an age. “The fact that an
old ideal is perishing,” remarks this writer, “must always be
a stronger or at least a more obvious moral influence than
the fact that a new one is coming into life.... A death is
more impressive than a birth.”<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></p>

<p>What in this reflection claims our attention here is the implied
truth that the passing of the old means the coming of
the new. At the base of the falling leaf there is always a new-forming
bud. It is not otherwise in the moral world. Unless
the forces of the moral life have become fatally impaired,
the decay of an old ideal of excellence is ever accompanied
by the growth of a new and better one. And it was so in the
Rome of the early Cæsars. The Roman ancestral ideal of
character, with its attractive civic and heroic virtues, was
indeed falling into decay and passing away, but a new and
better ideal of goodness was slowly forming and winning
the allegiance of the select spirits of the age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The three periods in the moral history of Rome</div>

<p>Lecky distinguishes in the moral history of pagan Rome
three periods characterized “by the successive ascendancy of
the Roman, the Greek, and the Egyptian spirit.” Up to near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
the end of the Republic the moral ideal was essentially Roman;
during the first and second centuries of the Empire it was
characterized by the dominance of the humanitarian and cosmopolitan
spirit of Greece; while in the third and last century
of the pagan Empire it was marked by the ascendency of the
Egyptian spirit of religious reverence.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> In the immediately
following pages we shall consider the second of these periods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modifying influence on the Roman ideal of the Greek spirit</div>

<p>Already at the time of the establishment of the Empire the
two great civilizations of classical antiquity had been in close
contact for a hundred years and more. The elements of Greek
culture which reacted most powerfully upon Roman society
were the purely intellectual and the ethical. History has fully
recognized the debt of Rome to Greek intellectualism, but it
has not so fully recognized her ethical debt to Hellenism.
Yet it was the contribution made by Greece to the new-forming
moral ideal of the Roman world which was probably
the most historically important element of the Hellenic
bequest. This ethical inheritance of Rome from Greece was
second only to her ethical heritage from Judea.</p>

<p>It was largely through the medium of Greek literature and
Greek philosophy, particularly the Platonic and the Stoic,
that the ethical Greek spirit, characterized by its humanitarian
and cosmopolitan sympathies, exerted its modifying influence
upon the Roman moral consciousness and gradually
changed it into something very different from what it was at
first. This influence can best be traced in Roman literature
and the imperial legislation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidences in literature of the softening of the moral feelings</div>

<p>The two great changes in the moral type consisted, as Lecky
observes, in the greater prominence accorded the benevolent or
amiable virtues, and in the broadening of the moral sympathies.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a>
The effect of the action of the humanitarian Greek spirit upon
the old Roman ideal of character was to soften its harsher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
features and to cause the heroic virtues to yield place, in a
measure, to the benevolent qualities, that is to say, to those
virtues which in the course of three centuries or more, largely
under Hebrew-Christian influences, were destined to assume
a dominant place in the accepted ideal of moral excellence.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a></p>

<p>Cicero, Vergil, Juvenal, and Seneca may be considered the
truest representatives of this new-forming social conscience.
Cicero, writing just at the end of the Republic and after
Rome for more than three generations had been under the
influence of Greek culture and philosophy, exhibits unmistakably
the effect upon the Roman character of the comparatively
humane and gentle spirit of Hellas. In his treatise <i>De Officiis</i>,
“concerning duties,” in which he interprets and enlarges for
the benefit of his son Marcus the ethical work of the Greek
philosopher Panætius, he gives his sanction to moral doctrines
which could hardly have been approved by a Roman moralist
before Rome had felt the influence of the ethical spirit of
Greece. The work is a glorification of the virtues of pity,
gentleness, and benevolence.</p>

<p>The softening movement finds another representative in
Vergil. His great poem is in its ethical spirit more Greek
than Roman. In the “transformation of the goddess of lawless
self-pleasing love into a goddess of a maternal compassionate
love,” Wedgwood would have us see summed up the
change in moral feeling of the classical world during the
centuries that separated the age of the <i>Iliad</i> from that of
the <cite>Æneid</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></p>

<p>Juvenal,<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> too, applauds the moral qualities of pity and tenderness.
“His moral tone appears to unite the spirit of two
different ages.”<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> Seneca denounced the gladiatorial games as
inhuman and degrading. He constantly lays emphasis upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
those amiable virtues which belong rather to the Greek than
to the Roman ideal of moral excellence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethical theory finds embodiment in practice</div>

<p>Nor was this moral evolution confined to ethical theory;
these precepts of the moralists found generous embodiment
in practice. Especially was the age of the Antonines a benevolent
age, one in which all kinds of charities abounded. Respecting
private benefactions in this period Professor Samuel
Dill asserts that we may well doubt whether they were less
numerous and generous than at the present day, and that
“there has probably seldom been a time when wealth was
more generally regarded as a trust, a possession in which the
community at large has a right to share.”<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> These numerous
gifts and legacies assumed the form of baths, theaters,
libraries, markets, colonnades, aqueducts, fountains, temples,
basilicas, and other monuments of utility or adornment.</p>

<p>The motives which led to all this public giving were of
course mixed, just as are the motives of givers of to-day, but
we may without much hesitation assume with the historian
Dill that they sprang largely from genuine altruistic feeling,
from a recognition of the true uses of wealth, and from a
sense of the duty of the rich to the poor and dependent—from
the same motives, in a word, that a century or two later
were to cover these same lands with churches and monasteries
and oratories.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The broadening movement: ethical universalism as the outcome of the world empire and of Stoicism</div>

<p>The second important ethical movement in the pre-Christian
Roman world consisted, as we have seen, in the widening of
the moral sympathies. The two most efficient causes of this
movement were the establishment of the world empire and
the ascendancy at Rome of Greek philosophy, particularly the
philosophy of the Stoics.</p>

<p>Never before in the history of the world down to our own
day were there so many forces and circumstances making for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
cosmopolitanism in life and thought as in the age of the early
Cæsars. The growth of the little city state of Rome into a
world state had made all freemen actually or potentially citizens
of the world. The political unity of the world had
awakened the consciousness of a moral unity. In thought and
feeling many select souls recognized themselves as brothers
of all other men. It was not merely the world-wide reach of
the Roman rule that promoted the growth of this cosmopolitanism,
but contributing largely to it were the policies of the
imperial government, many of whose agencies and institutions
made directly and powerfully for the development of a sentiment
of universal human kinship. The unification of the
world on its physical side, by the creation of the splendid
Roman roads and the facilities thus provided for world-wide
trade and travel, had the same broadening effect upon the
moral feelings that modern railways, steamboats, and telegraphs
have upon the ethical sympathies of our own day.
Furthermore, the practically autocratic authority of the Emperor
tended to destroy class distinctions by reducing all to the
same level of servitude, to obliterate national boundaries, and
to weaken race prejudices. Then also, as the capital of the
world, Rome had become, as a center and creator of cosmopolitan
life, a second Alexandria. The character, too, of the
slaves, drawn now largely from the East, and often superior
in culture to their masters, tended to blur the distinctions
between classes based on outer conditions, and to suggest the
doctrine of equality in the sphere of the spirit. The army,
also, recruited from every race and land in the Empire, and
from the outside barbarian world as well, with the legions
raised in one country serving in another, was a liberalizing
agency, and a most effective one in breaking down race barriers
and in widening the mental outlook and the moral
sympathies of the traveled legionaries.</p>

<p>The second great cause of the enlarging of the moral
feelings was the influence of the Greek spirit. Indeed, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
broadening movement was in large measure the effect of the
action of the cosmopolitan spirit of the Stoic philosophy upon
the originally narrow spirit of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> Evidences in literature
of this widening of the moral horizon multiply from Terence
in the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to the age of the Antonines. The
familiar sentiment of the poet, “I am a man and nothing
human is alien to me,”<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> although we know nothing as to the
response this evoked in the readers of Terence, may fairly be
accepted as evidence that the new spirit of cosmopolitanism
was already at work in Roman society. But the first clear
sustained note of universalistic morality comes from Cicero
in his treatise <i>De Officiis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> to which we have already referred.
The author says much about the Law of Nature and of the
society and community of the human race. One should, in
imitation of Hercules, even at the cost of great labor and
pain, give succor and aid to every one, whoever he may be,
for this is consonant with nature.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> In destroying Corinth
Rome was guilty of a great crime.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> The human race forms
a universal society, by virtue of the bond of reason and
speech; therefore we are to do good to all men—but liberality
should begin at home.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> “The love of humanity,” he says,
“which has its beginnings in the love of parents for their
offspring, binds together first the members of the family;
then, gradually reaching out beyond the domestic circle, embraces
successively relatives, friends, neighbors, fellow citizens;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
next broadens to include allied nations; and finally comes to
embrace the whole human race.”<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a></p>

<p>Two generations later, in the reign of Nero, Seneca enjoined
the same cosmopolitan morality. He declared all men
to be citizens of a universal commonwealth, and inculcated
the lofty sentiment, “Man should be sacred to his fellow
man.” Epictetus in the same age preached a like doctrine of
human fraternity, and taught that a man should regard himself
not as a citizen of this or of that city, but as a citizen
of the world.</p>

<p>But it is in the <i>Meditations</i> of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius
that we find the most emphatic declaration of this Stoic
doctrine of the unity of mankind and the universal reach of
the moral law. As envisioned by the emperor-philosopher
the whole world is a single state and all men are fellow
citizens. “My city and country,” he says, “so far as I am
Antoninus, is Rome, but so far as I am a man, it is the
world.”<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> Again he muses: “The poet says, Dear city of
Cecrops; and wilt not thou say, Dear city of Zeus?”<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a>
Every man, he declares, should remember that every rational
being is his kinsman, and that “to care for all men is according
to man’s nature;”<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> for “men exist for the sake of one
another.”<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a></p>

<p>In what measure these moralists and philosophers whom
we have quoted really represented their times it is of course
impossible to say; but probably we would not be wrong in
assuming that they appealed to a certain public sentiment, and
that the doctrines they taught evoked consenting response<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
from the moral consciousness of more than a few in every
rank of Roman society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stoic doctrine of the Law of Nature and its ethical influence</div>

<p>The doctrine of the Law of Nature, upon which such emphasis
was laid by the Stoic philosophers, had such consequences
for the evolution of Roman morals and so great an
influence upon the moral philosophers of later times, particularly
upon the speculations of the philosophers of the
eighteenth century, that we must in the present connection
endeavor to gain some idea of what the Stoics meant by this
phrase, and the ethical value of the conception.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a></p>

<p>The Law of Nature is merely the Stoic designation of a
law which, under other names, all the ages have revered as
the supreme law of the universe. It is practically the law of
conscience, the inner law written on the hearts of men.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> It
is that law which is in the background of our consciousness
when we say, “We must obey God rather than man.” It is
that holy law which came to Hebrew prophet as the word of
Jehovah. It is that inviolable law which Antigone feared to
break, “a law not proclaimed by men, and which lives not for
to-day nor yesterday, but evermore.”<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> It is what the Supreme
Court of the United States in a recent decision calls “the rule
of reason,” that inborn sense of what is reasonable and just.</p>

<p>This Law of Nature being thus the expression of what is
most constituent and essential in man as man, it necessarily
results that there is a large common element in the customs
and the rules of conduct of all peoples who are in the same or
nearly the same stage of culture; hence the substantial conformity
between the Law of Nature and the Laws of Nations.
The conformity, however, is not perfect. The moral task of
humanity is to make it perfect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>It is of course the ethical imperative of the Law of Nature
which has rendered it such a revolutionary and reconstructive
force in history. During the medieval period it was seldom
invoked because the Church and not the normal human reason
was regarded as the supreme authority in the domain of
morals. But after the Renaissance and the Reformation had
proclaimed the autonomy of the individual spirit and the ultimate
authority of the individual conscience in the realm of
moral right and wrong, then came naturally an appeal from
the rules and conventions of society to the unwritten Law of
Nature; hence the prominence it assumed in the writings
of the philosophers of the eighteenth century, who prepared
the way for the French Revolution.</p>

<p>But what it concerns us now to notice is merely the influence
of this conception of a Law of Nature on the moral
development in the later period of the Roman Empire. A
fundamental principle of the law, as apprehended by the
Stoics, is that men are born free and equal. If this teaching
be received as axiomatic, it is easy to understand its importance
for morality. Tried by this touchstone, many social institutions,
such for instance as slavery, are shown at once to be
contrary to nature, and hence opposed to natural justice. The
acceptance of this Stoic doctrine by the Roman jurists caused
the Roman law, as we shall see immediately, to be molded
in opposition to servitude and in the interest of freedom.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of Stoicism as an ethical force on Roman government and law</div>

<p>In its moral influence Stoicism worked in the Roman world
more like a religion than a philosophy. In truth it was a
missionary philosophy. It created in a remarkable measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
moral enthusiasm. “In the Roman Empire,” declares Lecky,
“almost every great character, almost every effort in the
cause of liberty, emanated from the ranks of Stoicism.”<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a></p>

<p>In the first place it presented an ideal of monarchy which
powerfully influenced Roman imperialism.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> It made the
prince “the shepherd of his people.” It taught that the
sole aim of the ruler should be “the good of his subjects.”
The effects of these teachings were evident in the rule of
more than one of the pagan emperors. The blessings which
the reigns of Pius and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and
others of the “good emperors” brought to the Roman world
are to be attributed in large measure to the influence upon
these rulers of the doctrines and ideals of Stoicism. In the
beneficent rule of these Stoic emperors the ideal of Plato
and Dion was realized; the philosopher was upon the throne.
Only in the effects of the teachings of the philosophers of
the eighteenth century upon the Enlightened Despots of
that period do we find a like illustration of the influence
of philosophy upon the possessors of absolute power.</p>

<p>The enlightened and humane spirit of Stoicism was felt
especially in the law.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> It was the Stoic doctrine of the natural
equality of all men that worked most effectively in this
domain. Many of the disabilities placed upon woman by
the earlier law were removed; children were emancipated
in a measure from the now unreasonable authority of the
father;<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> and the slave was placed under the protection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
the law and safeguarded against the worst brutalities of a
cruel master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amelioration of slavery under the pagan emperors</div>

<p>The mitigation of the lot of the slave constitutes so important
a phase of the moral evolution of the pre-Christian period
that we must consider it here apart and in some detail. The
causes of this moral reform were various. Among the most
efficient agencies were Stoicism and the other Greek philosophies.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a>
Then the character of many of the slaves themselves,
the equal or superior often of their master in intelligence and
culture, won for the class respect and consideration. Furthermore,
the great number of freedmen, who constituted a very
large element of the free population of the Empire,<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> tended
to create a public sentiment favorable to the slave. Having
had, like Epictetus the Stoic, acquaintance with the bitterness
of bondage, they knew how to pity the bondsman.</p>

<p>Already in the first century of the Empire all the chief
leaders of moral reform taught that the slave is the equal
of his master in capacity for virtue.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> Dion Chrysostom condemned
hereditary slavery as contrary to the Law of Nature
and hence wrong. He is thought to have been the earliest
writer in the Roman Empire to take this advanced moral
ground.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> Seneca proclaimed the obligations of the higher
law: “Although our laws,” he says, “permit a master to
treat his slave with every degree of cruelty, still there are
some things that the common law of life forbids being done
to a human being.”<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> Cruel masters, he adds, are hated and
detested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>The growing sentiment of tenderness for the slave found
significant popular expression in the reign of Nero. A certain
prefect of the city having been murdered by a slave, the
Senate, in accordance with ancient usage, adjudged to death
the entire household of slaves, four hundred in number. Sentiment
in the Senate itself was divided, some of the senators
voting against the proposal, while the people gathering in
seditious crowds threatened to prevent by force the carrying
out of the edict. A body of soldiers was necessary to overawe
the populace and secure the execution of the slaves.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a></p>

<p>A little later we see these growing humanitarian feelings
reflected in the imperial legislation. Hadrian took away from
masters the ancient right willfully to kill their slaves; and
Antoninus Pius made the killing of a slave, <i lang="la">sine causa</i>, murder.
The edicts of other emperors effected further mitigations of
the law, so that the slave code of the later pagan Empire is
characterized by a humaneness of spirit that places it in strong
contrast with the callousness of the code of earlier times.</p>

<p>Additional evidence of the increased humanity of the age
is afforded by the numerous manumissions of slaves.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> The
motives that prompted such action were undoubtedly mixed,
one self-regarding motive being the ambition to have a great
retinue of clients;<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> but the dominant motive is unquestionably
to be sought in the growing humanity of the age.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the greatest alleviations of slavery
were effected before the influence of Christianity was felt.
The Christian emperors added almost nothing to the laws of
the pagan Empire ameliorating the lot of the slave, and the
Christian bishops in general fell behind Seneca in advocacy
of the cause of the bondsman. The emphasis laid by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Church upon a future life where the poor and the oppressed
of this world should receive compensation for their wrongs
and sufferings here, caused the Christian teachers to regard
earthly rank and outer conditions of life as of little moment.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethics of the persecution of the Christians by the pagan emperors</div>

<p>While considering the steady expansion of the moral
sympathies and the growth of humanitarian sentiment in the
pagan Empire, we are confronted by the startling fact that
the best of the emperors, those most closely identified with
the legislation embodying the new spirit of humanity and justice,
were among the most severe and persistent persecutors
of the Christians.</p>

<p>This apparent moral paradox is the same as will again
confront us in the medieval age in connection with the
Inquisition and the cruel persecution of heretics and dissenters
by a Church which was based on the principle of
universal love, and which exalted to the highest place in its
ideal of goodness the qualities of gentleness and pity.</p>

<p>The paradox in each case is, however, such only in seeming.
The persecution of Christians by pagans, and of heretics
by Christians, was practically the inevitable issue of certain
ideas and beliefs which became the premises of moral conclusions.
In neither case does the act of the persecutor necessarily
imply moral turpitude.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> The persecution of the Christians
by the pagan emperors sprang in the main from the belief—in
connection with the idea of corporate responsibility—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
the welfare of the state was bound up with the careful observance
of the rites of the temple.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> It was thought that the
neglect of the temple service by any single member of the
community awakened the resentment of the gods toward all
the members alike. If the Tiber overflowed its banks, the
people were ready to believe that the calamity had been
brought upon the city by the neglect of the new sect to offer
the customary sacrifices to the gods, and the cry arose, “The
Christians to the lions!” In a word, the refusal of the Christians
to participate in the common worship was looked upon
as a crime, as a species of treason against the state, and was
punished as such.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoic teachings Christian in tone and sentiment</div>

<p>As we are now approaching the time when a new moral
ideal, that of Christianity, is to displace the old classical ideal
of character, it will be both instructive and interesting to
note to what degree this ideal which was passing away had,
in theory if not in practice, under the varied influences to
which it had been subjected through the centuries, become
assimilated to this new ideal of excellence.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></p>

<p>The nobility of forgiveness was taught by many of the
pagan philosophers with Christian insistence. Cicero regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
repentance as perhaps sufficient to stay the hand of chastisement,
and declares that nothing is more laudable than clemency
and willingness to forgive.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> Marcus Aurelius would
repress even the first risings of resentment for injury: “When
one is trying to do thee harm, continue to be of a kind disposition
toward him, gently admonish him, and calmly correct
his error, saying, ‘Not so, my child; we are constituted
by nature for something else; I shall certainly not be injured,
but thou art injuring thyself, my child,’—and show him by
gentle tact and by general principles that this is so.”<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></p>

<p>And again: “It is royal to do good and to be abused”<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a>;
“be gentle toward those who try to hinder or otherwise
trouble thee.”<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> “The best way of avenging thyself is not
to become like [the wrongdoer].”<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> Epictetus quotes with
approval Pittacus, one of the Seven Wise Men, in these
words: “Forgiveness is better than revenge, for forgiveness
is the sign of a gentle nature, but revenge the sign of a
savage nature.”<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a></p>

<p>Purity and sincerity of thought is inculcated by Marcus
Aurelius. “A man should,” he says, “accustom himself to
think of those things only about which if one should suddenly
ask, What hast thou now in thy thought? with perfect openness
thou mightest immediately answer, This or that; so that
from thy word it should be plain that everything in thee is
simple and benevolent.”<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a></p>

<p>Seneca taught that adversity has moral uses: “God does not
pamper the good man; he puts him to the test to prove him,
he hardens him, and thus prepares him for himself.”<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> Trust
in Providence and resignation is inculcated by Marcus Aurelius
in many passages in which he teaches that one should accept
with all his soul everything which happens to him as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
portion assigned by God. He trusts in Him who governs;
he says to the universe, “I love as thou lovest.”<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> He accepts
death with perfect resignation whether it be extinction, or
birth into another life: “To go away from among men is
not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods, if there be gods,
will not involve thee in evil.”<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> But death may be extinction.
If so, well; for “if it ought to have been otherwise, the gods
would have ordered it so.”<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a></p>

<p>Strangely Christian in tone are the reflections of Marcus
Aurelius on the transitoriness of earthly life: “What belongs
to the soul is a dream and vapor, and life is a warfare
and a stranger’s sojourn.”<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a></p>

<p>The duty of godlikeness is enjoined by Epictetus: “He
who seeks to please the gods must labor as far as in him lies
to resemble them. He must be faithful as God is faithful,
free as He is free, beneficent as He is beneficent, magnanimous
as He is magnanimous.”<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> Marcus Aurelius sums up
the duty of man in love to his fellows and in following God;<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a>
and Plutarch declares that “man can enjoy no greater blessing
from God than to attain to virtue by the earnest imitation
of the noblest qualities of the divine nature.”<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Some divergences between Roman and Christian ethics</div>

<p>But while in many of the teachings of the leaders of moral
thought in the later Roman Empire, as shown by the above
quotations, we find a near approach to Christian ethics, or a
perfect accordance therewith, still it is a fact that must not
be overlooked or minimized that in other of their teachings
in which they represented more truly the popular conceptions
of right and wrong, they as conspicuously diverged from the
Christian ideal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<p>We have heard some of the moralists, particularly the Stoic
Marcus Aurelius, condemning the spirit of revenge and extolling
forgiveness as a virtue; but in general the Stoics as
well as the followers of other schools had not advanced beyond
the common conscience of the time in regard to the
permissibility and even duty of returning injury for injury.
Cicero unequivocally approved the taking of revenge for injuries
received;<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> only the person injured should avenge himself
equitably and humanely.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> Again he says that justice
requires that no one should do harm to another, “unless
in requital of some injury received.”<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> Even the gentle Plutarch,
who may be regarded as representing the composite
ideal of character which was forming in the first century of
the Empire through the union of Greek and Roman ethical
ideas and feelings, declares it to be a virtue to make one’s
self disagreeable to one’s enemies.</p>

<p>Tyrannicide, which in general is condemned by the modern
conscience, was given by the Roman moralist, as by the Greek
teachers, a place among the greatest of the virtues. Cicero
deems it a meritorious act to slay a tyrant on the ground that
he is but a “ferocious beast in the guise of a man,”<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> and
declares that of all illustrious deeds the Roman people regard
tyrannicide the most laudable.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> Consistently he extols the
killing of the Gracchi.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a></p>

<p>Pity or compassion for suffering, which is assigned such a
high place in the Christian type of character, was regarded
by the Roman moralists as a weakness, even a vice; not
but that they extolled clemency in the ruler, but they distinguished
between this sentiment and that of pity. Seneca
declared pity to be a vice incident to weak minds. “The
wise man,” he said, “will dry the tears of others but will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
not add his to theirs. He will not pity those in distress,
but will relieve and aid them.”<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a></p>

<p>Suicide, which to the modern conscience appears a censurable
act, was by most of the Roman moralists regarded
with unqualified approval,<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> provided the person committing
the act had a strong motive for doing so. Epictetus said,
“The door is open”; but added this admonition, “Do not
depart without a reason.”<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> But almost any circumstance
which made life hard or a burden would justify the act; “The
house is smoky, and I quit it,” calmly remarks the Stoic
Emperor Aurelius.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> Seneca says, “The eternal law has
decreed nothing better than this, that life should have but
one entrance and many exits.”<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> He thinks the gods must
have looked on with great joy when Cato, with the world
fallen into Cæsar’s power, drove the sword into his own
breast. That in his view was “a glorious and memorable
departure.” By such an act a man raises himself to the
level of the gods.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a></p>

<p>Suicide was at its height in the early Empire. This is to
be explained by the teachings of the Stoics—among whom
suicides were numerous<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a>—and the unbearable tyranny of
the imperial régime. Not till Christianity came with its teachings
regarding the sacredness of human life and the duty of
resignation was there any essential change in the general attitude
of the ancient world toward the act of self-destruction.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The insufficiency of Stoicism as a moral guide for the masses</div>

<p>The composite Greco-Roman ideal, in which Stoicism
had united the best elements of the Greek and the Roman
type of character, while it did serve as a guide to the moral
strivings of select souls, was wholly unfitted to give support
to the moral life of the masses or to awaken in them moral
enthusiasm. There were in Stoicism two serious defects
which made it impossible for it to become the guide and rule
of life for the multitude. First, it was too intellectually
exalted and cold to make appeal to the common people. The
Stoics, in the suppression of the feelings and emotions,—“they
made solitude in the heart and called it peace,”<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a>—cut
themselves off from all sympathy with the masses, with
whom feeling is ever the larger part of life. Second, Stoicism
failed to give due place to the religious sentiment. Belief in
the ancestral Roman gods had, it is true, been undermined,
but the religious feeling of awe and mystery in the presence of
the Unseen was deeper and more universal than ever before.
Man, in the fine phrase of Sabatier, is incurably religious.</p>

<p>The ideal of character which shall appeal to the masses
must be an ideal whose requirements make full recognition
of the rightful claims of human affections and of the religious
instinct of mankind. The mystical and religious
East contributes to the ideal created by the interaction of the
Greek and the Roman spirit those elements which neither of
the classical cultures could supply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Orient contributes new elements to the moral life of the West</div>

<p>From the first century of our era, Rome was in close contact
with the Orient, as long before she had been in contact
with Greece. And just as the Greek spirit had profoundly
influenced the moral ideal of Rome, so now was the spirit
of the Orient to effect even greater changes in her ancestral
standard of character.</p>

<p>As philosophy mediated between Rome and Greece, so
did religion mediate between Rome and the Orient. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
through the religions or cults of Egypt, Persia, and Judea
that the ethical forces of the ancient cultures of the East
were brought to bear on Roman life and thought and conduct.
In the present connection we shall speak only of the
influences which went forth from Egypt and Persia, and point
out in what way they gave an added impulse to that ethical
movement going on in the Roman world which finally culminated
in the triumph of the creed and moral ideal of Judea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The contribution of Egypt; the worship of Isis</div>

<p>And first we note the relation to this ethical evolution
of the worship of Isis and Serapis, the chief imported and
modified cults of the ancient civilization of the Valley of the
Nile. In this worship religion and morality were joined in
a way practically unknown to the priestly colleges of Rome.
“The Egyptian,” says Lecky, “... bowed low before the
divine presence. He veiled his eyes, he humbled his reason, he
represented the introduction of a new element into the moral
life of Europe, the spirit of religious reverence and awe.”<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a></p>

<p>Forming an important part of the body of ideas which constituted
the basis of this religious feeling, was the doctrine
of a life after death. This was a doctrine which was common
to all the Oriental religions with which we have here
to do,—the Isiac, the Mithraic, and the Christian,—but a
doctrine which, aside from the initiates of the Orphic, the
Eleusinian, and like Mysteries, was practically new to the
classical world. It was this doctrine which helped greatly to
secure for these religions or cults such wide acceptance in
the Roman world,—for the Roman world, old, worn, and
weary, was yearning for assurance of another and better life,—and
which largely explains the moral influence they
exerted upon the nations of the West.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a></p>

<p>For more than five hundred years the worship of Isis
particularly found ardent devotees in the West. The general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
effect of the cult upon its followers was to cause the active,
heroic qualities in the old Roman ideal of character to be
overshadowed by the passive contemplative virtues, and to
impart a religious, ritual character to the moral code. Expiatory
and purification rites formed a large part of the duties
of the worshiper of the Egyptian goddess.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The contribution of Persia: Mithraism</div>

<p>The influence of Egypt upon the religious-ethical life of
the West was reënforced by a like influence from Persia,
which came through the cult of Mithra.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> This worship came
into Europe by the way of Asia Minor. Its missionaries were
seemingly Oriental recruits in the Roman legions. It came
bearing many accretions gathered in its passage through the
west Asian lands, and yet with all the characteristics which
marked the old Persian religion as a religion of combat and
strenuousness, of moral striving and moral achievement.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a>
During the last three centuries of the Empire the cult
spread widely in the Western lands, taking deep root especially
in the frontier regions of the Danube and the Rhine,
and in the remote province of Britain.</p>

<p>This incoming of Mithraism had special significance for
the reason that Mithra, as the god of light, was invested with
certain moral qualities symbolized by his physical attributes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
He was the god of truth and purity. It was this moral
element in the cult, in connection with its doctrine of a
future life,—the promise and hope of which was dependent
upon purification, inward as well as ceremonial, from all
earthly stains and impurities,—which in a measure met and
satisfied the yearnings of the age, and which, in the great religious
and ethical propaganda that marked the later centuries
of the Roman Empire, rendered the religion of Mithra the
most formidable rival of Christianity in its great competition
with the various Oriental religions and cults for supremacy in
the hearts and consciences of men.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation of the Egyptian and Persian propaganda to that of Christianity</div>

<p>But the pagan priest no more than the pagan philosopher
could effect the moral renovation of ancient society. Like
the moral propaganda carried on by Cynic, Stoic, and Neoplatonist
missionaries and preachers, these efforts of paganism
to effect its own moral regeneration failed, perhaps because
these pagan cults lacked what Christianity possessed—“the
dynamic of a great personality.” Yet these efforts were not
without influence upon the ethical development of the Western
nations. In two ways the Egyptian and Persian propaganda
was a preparation for the moral revolution effected
by Christianity: first, it helped to give morality a religious
basis, which it did not have in classical antiquity; and second,
it taught men to seek in deity and not in themselves the
pattern of moral excellence.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> Thus did Egypt and Persia,
through the mediation of religion, contribute important ethical
elements to Greco-Roman civilization, and thereby help
to give a fresh impulse and a new trend to the moral evolution
of the Western world.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ETHICS OF DOCTRINAL CHRISTIANITY: AN
IDEAL OF RIGHT BELIEF</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ethical import of the Christianization of Rome</div>

<p>The establishment of Christianity, in its Greco-Judaic
form, as the favored religion of the Roman Empire by the
edict of the Emperor Constantine is rightly regarded as one
of the most important events not only in the history of the
Empire but also in that of the Western world. What made
this act, or rather the religious revolution it registered, of
such transcendent importance was the fact that the ascendancy
of the new religion meant the ascendancy of a new
moral ideal; for Christianity, unlike Stoicism, did not merely
act upon the old classical ideal of excellence to modify and
remold it, but superseded it by another made up largely of
a wholly different set of virtues.</p>

<p>It was this new ethical element thus introduced into
Greco-Roman civilization which was the most dynamic of
the forces active in the transformation of the ancient into
the medieval world. The new ideal re-created ethically the
Roman world and made Europe for a thousand years and
more—until the Renaissance of the fifteenth century called
forth again the ethical thought and feeling of classical antiquity—in
moral conviction and striving an extension of Asia.</p>

<p>A prerequisite to an intelligent study of the history of this
new moral ideal is a knowledge of the beliefs and theological
doctrines out of which it arose; for this ideal has through the
centuries followed the fortune of these beliefs and teachings.
In the immediately following pages we shall indicate what
were some of the most influential of these ideas and doctrines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<h3 id="toclink_256">I. <span class="smcap">Religious Ideas and Theological Dogmas molding
the Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of a moral law supernaturally revealed</div>

<p>Among the doctrines of Christian theology freighted
heavily with ethical consequences was that of a moral law
supernaturally promulgated. This was essentially an Oriental
conception, a heritage of Christianity from the Hebrew past,
and a conception quite alien in general to the manner of
thinking of the Greeks and Romans, with whom morality, as
we have seen, was a civic and secular and human thing, an
expression of man’s essential nature, that is, an outcome of
the human reason and conscience.</p>

<p>This doctrine exercised an immense influence upon the
moral evolution in the Western world. First, it displaced
naturalism with supernaturalism in ethics. The whole history
of morals records no revolution more momentous than this.
Second, it made rigid large sections of the moral code and
thus tended to impart for an historical epoch a certain immobility
to the religious-ethical side of European civilization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The teaching of the unity of God and of his universal fatherhood</div>

<p>Another idea found in this body of religious doctrines, an
idea rich in ethical consequences, was the conception of God
as one and as the Universal Father. We have seen that the
great defect in primitive morality was the limited range of the
moral feelings. The circle of moral obligation was bounded
by the clan, the tribe, the city. This resulted in large part
from the notion that each kin group had an origin and
ancestry different from that of every other. One group
thought themselves to be the offspring of Zeus; another proclaimed
themselves to be the descendants of Heracles; and
still another believed themselves to be the children of Mars.
So long as this view of men’s origin and descent prevailed
there could arise no conception of their spiritual relationship
and ethical oneness. Tacitus merely expressed the common
opinion of the ancient world when he declared absurd the
doctrine that all men are brothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>But from the doctrine of the common fatherhood of God
there arises naturally the conception of the essential brotherhood
of men. The apostle’s declaration, “We are the offspring
of God,”<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a>—phrasing the teachings of the Master in
terms understood by the men to whom he spoke,—announced
the opening of a new era in the moral development of the race.
The proclamation of this practically new thought<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> meant, at
once in ethical theory and sooner or later in actual practice,
the widening of the narrow class and race circle of moral
obligation to include all tribes and peoples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of a future life of rewards and punishments</div>

<p>Greco-Roman morality was influenced but slightly by a belief
in a life after death. The vision of the other world was in
general too indistinct for it to exert any decided influence
upon the conduct of men.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> The conception of Hades, though
it did undergo with the lapse of time a process of moralization,
was never so far ethicalized as to have a positive moral value.</p>

<p>But by Christianity the other world was lifted into such
prominence as it had had in the life and thought of no
people of antiquity except the Egyptians, and immortality
was declared to be the destiny of every human soul. With the
classical peoples it was the city which had been conceived
as eternal. This transference of immortality from the city
to the individual had vast import for morality.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> What contributed
to render it of such ethical importance was the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
that the after life was conceived as a life of rewards and
punishments. A heaven of ineffable and everlasting bliss
and a hell of unutterable and everlasting torment were laid
open to the eyes of men, and became the tremendous sanctions
of the new moral code promulgated by Christianity. It
would be difficult to exaggerate the influence of this teaching
upon the moral life of the European peoples, especially
during the medieval centuries of faith. To make this life
transitory, vain, and worthless, and life in another world the
only real life, is to cause the transvaluation of all moral
values, and to change fundamentally conceptions of what is
rational and right in conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The teaching of the sanctity of human life</div>

<p>Springing naturally from the foregoing conceptions of
man’s origin and eternal destiny is the Christian doctrine of
the sanctity of human life. In no respect do Christian teachings
contrast more sharply with pagan conceptions than in
this regard. In the Greco-Roman view value did not attach
to man as man. To the Greek way of thinking it was the
Greek freeman alone who possessed the full capacity for
virtue and the rights of manhood. In the common Roman
view only the Roman citizen was regarded as dowered with
the full faculties and rights of a human being. The slave
was looked upon and treated as belonging to an inferior
order of existence.</p>

<p>The Christian doctrine of man’s divine sonship and of
his eternal destiny gave infinite worth to every human life,
and, investing man as man with an inviolable sanctity, worked
effectively in widening the range of the moral sympathies
and in bringing within the scope of the moral law all classes
and conditions of men. It checked infanticide, which in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
pre-Christian world had been very generally practiced without
the least moral scruple; it suppressed the gladiatorial games
in which the lives of men were placed on a level with those
of the wild beasts with which they fought; it helped to make
suicide, which the Romans looked upon as a noble mode of
departure from life, a crime; and contributed to mitigate the
lot of the slave and finally to help lift him into freedom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dogma of the fall of man and hereditary guilt</div>

<p>The view of man’s moral nature taught by the Founder of
Christianity was simple and natural. It is embodied in the
parable of the prodigal son. Man may go wrong, but he has
ever the capacity, and, when he comes to himself, the desire,
to return to the right way.</p>

<p>In direct opposition to this view of man’s nature and deepest
preferences as being essentially good, we find elaborated
in early Christian theology the dogma that the first man,
though created upright, fell through disobedience and transmitted
to all his descendants a nature wholly evil and a total
incapacity for doing good or even desiring the good. And
not only was man thus attainted by the primal disobedience,
but all nature became accursed.</p>

<p>This dogma of the fall of man is one of the most influential
conceptions in the moral domain ever entertained by
the human mind. It was the germ from which was developed
the larger part of Christian theological ethics.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> For out of the
dogma of ancestral sin and total depravity sprang naturally
and logically the doctrines of the atonement, imputed righteousness,
and salvation through faith. The moral history of
the Christian centuries we shall find to be largely the history
of the influence of this doctrine upon men’s conceptions of
their religious obligations and duties. As with the passage of
time and the incoming of evolutionary science the belief in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
this teaching decays, we shall find men’s idea of what constitutes
duty in the religious sphere undergoing a great change,
and shall see acts, observances, and states of mind once regarded
as supremely virtuous and indispensable to salvation
now looked upon as morally indifferent or even positively wrong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of the sacredness of the Sabbath</div>

<p>Christianity inherited from Judaism the belief in the sacred
character of the Sabbath day. This belief created one of the
most important of the religious duties of the Christian. It
determined how one seventh of all his time should be spent.
The history of the observance of this Sabbath as holy time,
and the changed moral value attached to such observance
as times and beliefs have changed, forms a chapter of the
greatest suggestiveness to the student of the evolution of
morals, since this chapter epitomizes and repeats the entire
history of ceremonial or ritual morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The personality of the Prophet of Nazareth<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a></div>

<p>But far more influential than all these inherited Jewish
beliefs and doctrines of speculative theology in molding the
moral ideal of Christianity, in all that renders it superior to
the moral ideals of the other great religions of the world, as
well as in all that it possesses of permanent ethical value for
humanity, has been the simple appealing story of the words
and deeds of the Prophet of Nazareth.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> Those elements of
the ideal which are based on speculative theological doctrines
have changed as these doctrines have changed with the world’s
advance in general intelligence and with the deepening and
clarifying of the moral consciousness of men; while those
elements derived from that wonderful personality, from that
life of unbounded tenderness and love and self-forgetting
service, have been given an ever higher and more dominant
place in the world’s ideal of goodness. In the eloquent words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
of the historian Lecky: “It was reserved for Christianity to
present to the world an ideal character, which through all the
changes of eighteen centuries has inspired the hearts of men
with an impassioned love; has shown itself capable of acting
on all ages, nations, temperaments, and conditions; has been
not only the highest pattern of virtue but the strongest incentive
to its practice; and has exercised so deep an influence
that it may be truly said that the simple record of three short
years of active life has done more to regenerate and to soften
mankind than all the disquisitions of philosophers and the
exhortations of moralists. This has indeed been the well-spring
of whatever is best and purest in Christian life.”<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_261">II. <span class="smcap">The Moral Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Orthodoxy, or correct religious opinion, the indispensable saving virtue<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a></div>

<p>Before the end of the third century, under the influence
largely of the speculative Greek spirit, what was to be essentially
the historical creed of the Church had been practically
formulated and the corresponding moral code brought into
existence.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> In the creation of this standard of goodness which
was to give guidance for an epoch to the moral life of the
European peoples, it was the theological doctrine of the moral
value of faith, which came practically to be defined as “the
acceptance of the dogma of the Trinity and the main articles
of the creed,” that determined the precedence and subordination
of virtues and duties.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> Correct belief was made an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
indispensable virtue. Without this there could be no salvation.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a>
On the other hand, unbelief, doubt, error, even honest
error, in religious matters was declared to be in the highest
degree sinful. This conception that belief is a virtue and doubt
a sin was destined, since it imperils freedom of thought, to
have momentous and sinister consequences for the intellectual
and moral history of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The virtue of charity or love</div>

<p>Just as the theological dogma of the ethical value of religious
opinions has made correct belief theoretically the saving
virtue in Church ethics, so has the personality of Jesus, his
teachings and his self-sacrificing life as mirrored in the gospel
records, made love and service of others, in multitudes of
souls, practically the supreme and controlling motive of life.
It was the emphasis placed by primitive Christianity on this
virtue, and the persuasion to its practice afforded by the example
of the Master, that for the first two centuries of the
new era—until the emphasis became changed from right
living to right opinion—lent to the moral life in the Christian
communities of the Empire such sincerity, purity, and
elevation as have marked no other period in the history of
the Church.</p>

<p>But orthodox theology has never allowed that charity, though
combined with perfect uprightness of life and expressed in
noblest acts of self-abnegating service of humanity, is a saving
virtue unless associated with correctness of religious belief and
the outgrowth of it. This opposition in the bosom of the
Church itself between theological and natural morality has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
created a great dualism in the moral history of all the Christian
centuries, like the dualism in ancient Hebrew history
caused by the opposition between the morality of ritualism
and the morality of prophetism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The body of secondary virtues</div>

<p>Alongside the primary Christian virtue, whether this be regarded
as correct belief or as charity, were grouped a cluster
of secondary virtues, such as humility, meekness, gentleness,
compassion for weakness, resignation, and renunciation of the
world. What is especially noteworthy respecting this body of
moral qualities making up the Christian ideal of excellence is
that all these were virtues which in general were undervalued
or held in positive disesteem by the Greeks and Romans.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a>
Indeed it was made a matter of reproach to the early Christians
by the pagan opponents of Christianity, that its virtues
were all servile virtues—the virtues of the slave.</p>

<p>It was undoubtedly this character of the new ideal which
caused it, in the primal age of Christianity, to make such
strong appeal to the common people, to the despised and
lowly, to the broken and humble in spirit, in the aristocratically
graded society of the ancient world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creation of specific types through modifications of the general ideal</div>

<p>The Christian ideal of excellence has fulfilled itself in
many ways; that is, different types have arisen through the
shifting in rank of the virtues constituting the ideal, through
the incorporation of pagan elements, through racial influence,
and through the reaction upon the ideal of the changing intellectual,
political, and economic environment.</p>

<p>Generally these specific forms of the ideal have been created
by an exaggerated enthusiasm for one or another particular
virtue of the standard, which has caused this special
virtue so to overshadow all the others, save the indispensable
one of correct belief, as to bring into existence a distinctive
Christian type. Thus through the exaltation of the virtue
of chastity there arose in the early Church the ascetic type<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
of excellence, which for several centuries inspired unbounded
moral enthusiasm and drew away into the desert and into
the seclusion of the cloister great multitudes of both men
and women; later, through the reaction upon the Church
of the pagan and barbarian world it had nominally converted,
and through the incorporation into the ideal of a number of
heathen virtues, there came into existence a composite type
of character—a combination of the virtues of the saint and
the virtues of the hero—known as the chivalric ideal, which
colored the events of European history from the ninth to the
fourteenth century; and still later, through the suppression
of some of the distinctive virtues of the Roman Catholic type
of excellence and a fresh emphasis laid upon others, there
was created the Protestant type of moral character, which
has given a special cast to the theological morality of a large
section of modern Christendom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Limitations and defects of the ideal</div>

<p>That we may better be prepared to follow intelligently the
various phases of the moral history of the Christian centuries,
to the tracing of which the remaining chapters of this volume
will be devoted, there is need that to the brief description we
have now given of the chief virtues making up the ideal
which was to give guidance to the moral life of the European
peoples, we add a word concerning its limitations and defects,
since these negative qualities of the ideal have exercised an
influence scarcely less decisive than its positive qualities in
making the history of the Christian world what it has been—a
history, on the whole, of inspiring moral progress, yet a
history of moral losses as well as of moral gains.</p>

<p>The first limitation of the ideal which we notice is its
practical exclusion of those civic, patriotic duties and virtues
which had been so highly esteemed by both the Greeks and
the Romans. Man was henceforth to be the citizen of no
earthly city, but of a heavenly city whose builder and maker
is God. We can easily understand how this new conception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
of life, which transferred all its chief interests to another
world, which substituted the Church—symbolized in accordance
with the modes of thought of the time as “the city of
God”—for the ancient city state as the object of moral enthusiasm
and self-devotion, should leave no place for those
civic, military, and heroic virtues that had constituted the
very soul of the morality of classical antiquity.</p>

<p>A second limitation of the ideal is its neglect of the intellectual
virtues, which by the Greeks had been assigned such
a high place in their ethical standard.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> The slighting of this
important domain of ethics by Christian theology arose naturally
from its exaltation of faith above reason, and from
its assumption that in the revealed word the Church was
already in possession of all knowledge really essential to
man’s welfare and salvation.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a></p>

<p>But the chief defect of the ideal, the lamentable historical
consequences of which we shall witness later, is, as we have
already pointed out, in its making the acceptance of all the
articles of a given creed an indispensable virtue. In assigning
orthodox belief this place in the ideal of moral goodness, theological
ethics has marred Christian morality by fostering the
faults of intolerance and intellectual insincerity. This dogma
inspired in the Church, as soon as it became powerful, a persecuting
spirit, and made Christianity for centuries something
altogether alien to its real genius and spirit—one of the
most intolerant of the world’s religions. At the same time
this dogma, by making religious unbelief and nonconformity
a sin so heinous as to be worthy of death by the most exquisite
torture, and of everlasting punishment in the hereafter,
discouraged intellectual veracity and open-mindedness, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
fostered the vice of insincere conformity, which, more than
any other fault, has marred Church morality from the end of
the early age of the martyrs to the present day.</p>

ASCETICISM</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_267a">I. <span class="smcap">Conceptions of Life and Historical Circumstances
that produced the Ascetic Ideal</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">General fostering causes of asceticism</div>

<p>Before the close of the third century the development in
the Christian communities of the East of asceticism, the
germs of which were immanent from the first in Christianity,
had given a remarkable trend to the moral movement
inaugurated by the new religion. We shall gain a sympathetic
understanding of this phase of Christian ethics only
as we bear in mind the conceptions of life and of the world,
and the historical conditions which in general tend to foster
the development of the ascetic ideal of goodness.</p>

<p>Asceticism, a definitive characteristic of which is renunciation
of the world and all earthly pleasures, springs from
various roots. Sometimes it grows out of a dualistic world
philosophy, which, holding matter to be an evil creation and
“the corruptible body a load upon the soul,” teaches the
meritoriousness of the suppression, in the interest of the
spirit, of all bodily impulses and appetites.</p>

<p>Sometimes it arises from inequitable and oppressive conditions
of society, which have made life for the enslaved and
impoverished masses so joyless and wretched as to create an
inappeasable yearning for deliverance from its intolerable
burdens.</p>

<p>Again, it springs from a world philosophy, which, because
of its vivid vision of another world of eternal realities, undervalues
and reduces to nothingness this earthly life and all its
relationships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>Still again, it may spring from the soil of a morally decadent
civilization, for, unless the sources of spiritual life have been
wholly destroyed, from a debasing sensuality and dissoluteness
that rob life of worth and dignity there is ever sure to come a
reaction—a reaction expressing itself in an extreme emphasis
laid upon the worth and meritoriousness of world renunciation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fostering causes of Christian asceticism: (<i>a</i>) certain Christian teachings</div>

<p>Now in the case of Christianity there was, in the early
Christian centuries, an unusual concurrence of causes and
conditions conducive to the growth of asceticism. First, there
were virile germs of asceticism in the teachings of the new
religion. It taught that the things of the spirit are the only
abiding realities. It caused this earthly life to shrink into
insignificance and to disappear as it opened to the eyes of
faith the infinite perspectives of another world. The Master
said: “He that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto
life eternal.... Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not
all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.” And to the
young man who asked him what he should do to inherit
eternal life, he replied, “Sell all that thou hast, and distribute
unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven:
and come, follow me.” He seemed to set the relationships of
the spiritual life above the most intimate of earthly relationships
when he declared, “If any man come to me, and hate
not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and
brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot
be my disciple.” He taught the worthlessness of earthly
riches compared with the treasures of the spirit, and declared
that the rich should hardly enter into the kingdom
of heaven.</p>

<p>The disciples and near followers of the Master spoke in
like manner. These teachings tended directly and powerfully
to cause men to regard this earthly life as fleeting and
valueless, and to esteem those as choosing the better and
worthier part who, breaking all earthly ties and suppressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
all natural affections and desires, sought in the solitude of the
desert or the quiet of the cloister to win the life eternal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) The social and moral state of the Greco-Roman world</div>

<p>These seeds of Asian asceticism fell into a soil well fitted
to nourish them into a vigorous growth. The doctrine of
world renunciation was one easy of acceptance by the age
in which Christianity arose,<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> for the world into which primitive
Christianity entered was a senile, disillusioned, morally
corrupt, and life-weary world.</p>

<p>It was an aged and disillusioned world. The great races
of the East and the West, which had been the pioneers in
human culture, were now old. They had lost the youthful
zest of life. It was the disillusionment of age that predisposed
the minds of men to an acceptance of the doctrine of
deliverance through self-denial and renunciation of the world.</p>

<p>And this old world was morally corrupt. The vice of
ancient civilization in its senility was sensuality. Christian
asceticism was in part a recoil from this dissoluteness which
denied the worth and majesty of life.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a></p>

<p>And because it was a sensual world it was a life-weary
world. The prevailing mood of society of the Greco-Roman
Empire at the time of the great propaganda of Christianity
was one of satiety and weariness. It was a favorable moment
to preach contempt of the world and all earthly things.</p>

<p>Thus did the state of decrepitude and moral decadence
into which the cultured communities of the ancient world
had fallen, help to develop into a spirit of absolute world
renunciation the spirit of unworldliness which characterized
primitive Christianity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) The Platonic philosophy</div>

<p>Still another influence which contributed to give direction
and force to the ethical movement of the age was the Platonic
philosophy. There is in this philosophy an ascetic element.
Plato taught that a life of contemplation aloof from society is
the highest and the truly blessed life. This teaching was one
of the formative forces in the creation of the monastic ideal.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_270">II. <span class="smcap">The Ideal and its Chief Types</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The two types of the ascetic ideal: (<i>a</i>) the anchoretic; (<i>b</i>) the monastic</div>

<p>The moral ideal of Christian asceticism is, in its essential
elements, the same as the ascetic ideal of other religions. Its
leading requirement, after that of right belief, is, in comprehensive
terms, world renunciation. In the early Christian period
with which we have here to do, the ideal presented two types,
the anchoretic and the monastic. The anchoretic or eremite
conception of the perfect life was complete renunciation of
the world with all its domestic, social, business, and political
ties, and a life in the desert, apart from all human companionship,
spent in ceaseless vigils, prayer, and meditation. He
who followed this mode of life with the utmost rigor, who
suppressed every natural desire,—desire of family and wealth
and reputation and pleasure,—and tamed his body by fasting,
scourging, and other austerities was looked upon as a saint
and was regarded with peculiar homage and veneration.</p>

<p>Throughout the third and much of the fourth century in
all the countries of the Orient where Christianity had spread,
the anchoretic ideal was regarded as the highest and most
meritorious type of the Christian life. But as the ascetic enthusiasm
overspread the lands of the West, various influences,
such as climate and race temperament, caused the ascetics in
general to avoid the solitary life, and, gathering in communities,
to subject themselves to rules and the oversight of
superiors. After the legislation of St. Benedict (480–543 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>)
this quickly became the prevailing mode of life for ascetics.
Thus came into existence the monastic system with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
distinctive ideal of character, which added to the virtues of
the eremite ideal the virtue of obedience or humility and
abated somewhat its bodily austerities. This ideal was destined
to exercise for centuries a profound influence upon the
religious ethical evolution of the European peoples.</p>

<p>Both types are mirrored in <i>The Lives of the Saints</i>,<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> the
characteristic literary product of the earlier medieval time.
This species of literature, a creation of the pious inventiveness
of the monks, was steeped in the spirit that pervaded
hermitage and cloister. The tales illustrate many sides of
the life of the recluses, but are chiefly valuable in showing
what acts and practices were regarded as constituting the
most meritorious and morally excellent life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral standard for the ordinary life</div>

<p>The ascetic life was not binding upon all. It could not, of
course, become the universal mode of life. It was a sort of
extra service, which secured extra merit for him who rendered
it.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> It is true that the ascetic ideal absorbed a vast
amount of the moral enthusiasm of the age, nevertheless it
was a standard of moral attainment for the lesser number;
for the larger body of Christians there was the less exacting
ideal of excellence which could be realized in the ordinary
life in the world. He who practiced the common domestic,
social, and business virtues, who accepted the creed of the
Church, paid tithes to the priest, and was faithful in the
performance of all required religious duties, was accounted
a good man, and had the approval of his fellow men and
the approbation of his own conscience.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_272">III. <span class="smcap">The Chief Moral Facts of the Period</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Introductory</div>

<p>In the present division of this chapter it will be our aim
merely to indicate the essential facts in the moral history of
the earlier medieval centuries. Some of these facts will serve
to show in how remarkable a manner the age was dominated
by the monastic conception of good life, while others will
simply reveal the historical outworkings, in its more general
manifestations, of the new conscience brought into the world
by Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ideal of the saint and that of the hero: “Dialogue between Oisin and St. Patrick”</div>

<p>As a prelude to the brief review proposed we shall do well
to consider for a moment the contrariety between the new
ideal of the Christian monk and the old ideal of the pagan
hero as this oppositeness emerges in the so-called “Dialogue
between Oisin and St. Patrick.”<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> This poem discloses most
impressively the vast revolution which the incoming of Christianity
effected in the moral feelings and judgments of men.</p>

<p>Oisin, “the blind Homer of Erin,” is represented as in
his old age entering into a controversy with the saint respecting
the relative merits of the monk’s and the hero’s conception
of worthiness. The dialogue runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> Oisin, long is thy slumber, arise and listen to the psalm;
forsaken is thy activity, forsaken thy strength, yet wouldst thou delight
in battle and wild uproar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> My swiftness and my strength have deserted me since the Fenii,
with Fionn their chief, are no longer alive; for clerks I have no
attachment, and their melodies are not sweet to me.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>O Patrick, hard is thy service, and shameful is it for you to reproach
me for my appearance; if Fionn lived, and the Fenii, I
would forsake the clergy of the cross.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Patrick, pray thou to the God of heaven for Fionn of the Fenii
and for his children, making entreaty of the prince, whose equal I
have never heard of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> O learned man, I desire not strife with thee, but I will
not make request to heaven for Fionn, for all the actions of his life
were to be in love and to urge the sounding chase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> If you were to be in company with the Fenii, O clerk of clergy
and of bells, not for long wouldst thou be able to give heed to the
God of truth, and serve the clergy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> ... Oisin, the remainder of your life is short, and badly
will you fare if you despise the clergy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> Small is my esteem for thyself and clergy, O holy Patrick of the
crozier: I have greater regard for Fionn, the white-handed king of
the Fenii, but he is not near me now.</p>

<p>Mournful I am without his hounds bounding, and his dogs all
around me; if they and their agile hero were alive, Patrick, you
would have to fear rebuke from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> In that way did you and the Fenii of Erin forsake
heaven: you never submitted to religion, but ever put confidence
in strength of limbs, and in battles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> Were Fionn alive, and the Fenii comely and warlike, with their
hounds running propitiously, they would seem to me more majestic
than those who dwell in heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> Desolate are the Fenii, without slumber or liberty in the
house of torment, for never in any way did they render service to
the Holy Father.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> Fionn delighted in strokes upon shields, in conquering heroes,
and hunting on hills; the sound of his dogs in toil was more melodious
to me than the preaching of clerks in church of bells.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> It is because his time and delight were taken up by
pleasures of the chase, and the array of warlike hosts; and because
he never thought about God, that Fionn of the Fenii is in thralldom.</p>

<p>He is now shut up in torment; all his generosity and wealth do
not avail him now, for lack of piety toward God, for this he is in
sorrow, in the mansion of pain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> Little do I believe in thy speech, thou man from Rome with white
books, that Fionn the generous hero is now with demons and devils.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>O Patrick, doleful is the story: Fionn the hospitable to be under
locks! heart without malice and without aversion, heart stern in defense
of battle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> However great the number of troops fighting for Fionn,
he did not act the will of God above: his crimes are above him in
pains of fire, forever in anguish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> It is plain that your God does not delight in giving gold and
food to others: Fionn never refused strong or weak, and shall he
receive hell for his abode!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> However much he may have divided gold and venison,
hard are his bonds in the den of pains: no glimpse of light for him,
no sight of brightness such as he first received from God.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> Patrick, inquire of God if He remembers the Fenii when alive:
ask if, east or west, He ever saw men better in conflict.</p>

<p>Or did He observe in His own country, although it is high above
us, for sense, for conflict, or for strength, any man good in comparison
with Fionn?</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Patrick, I am wretched, a poor bard, ever changing residence, without
power, without activity, without force, journeying to mass and altars.</p>

<p>Without good food, without getting wealth and booty, without
play in athletic games; without going a-wooing and hunting, two
objects for which I always longed.</p>

<p>Without reciting deeds of champions, without bearing spear; alas!
I have lost Osgur and Fionn, and I am left standing like a withered
tree, out under injury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> Cease, O Bard! Leave off thy folly; you have as yet
said but little in favour of yourself: think of the torments that await
you; the Fenii are departed, and ere long you will go likewise.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> I will not obey you, O Patrick, though great your creed and
faith. I own without lie that firm is my belief that the devil will be
your portion.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>I would rather return to the Fenii once more, O Patrick, if they
were alive, than go to the heaven of Jesus Christ, to be forever under
tribute to Him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> O withered Bard, thou art foolish; thou wouldst not
pay tribute to any one if thou wast in the heaven of Jesus Christ,
nor wouldst thou witness battle and uproar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> I would rather be in Fionn’s court harkening to the voices of
hounds every morning, and meditating on hard-fought battles, than
in the court of Jesus Christ; that is certain.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It was easier for me to obtain without fail both meat and drink in
Fionn’s court than in thy mansion, and in the dwelling of the Son
of God, O Patrick, not generous in dividing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> It is better for thee to be with me and the clergy, as
thou art, than to be with Fionn and the Fenii, for they are in hell
without order of release.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> By thy book and its meaning, by thy crozier and by thy image,
better were it for me to share their torments, rather than be among
the clergy continually talking.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Ah! Patrick, your religion may be great; but I have not, up to
this day, witnessed among ye dinner nor banquet like banquet of
the Fenii.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> Although Fionn spent generously all he obtained by
strength, fleetness, and plunder, he is now sorrowful in the mansion
of a lord who furnishes no dinner, and demons torment him forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> It would be pitiful and mournful, if thy story were true, ah
Patrick! for all the saints who are in heaven, if they were to strive
with Fionn in contest of liberality, could not obtain the victory
over him.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Tell to me without controversy what is the reason of the custom
you have to be ever beating your breasts, and each evening kneeling
under gloom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick.</span> I tell thee that it is not because we have scarcity of food
and of drink that we are under armour (watching), but because we
desire to be perpetually on our guard against gluttony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oisin.</span> It is not fear of gluttony, nor in dread of king of saints that I
receive for myself scarcity of bread, but because I am not able to
obtain it from the clergy.</p>

<p>Astonishment is upon me to witness the greatness of your love
for the man you call Christ, if hereafter he will perpetually upbraid
you for the abundance of your portions and of your drink!</p>

<p>Farewell to Fionn of the noble Fenii; with him was ample banquet
and division; he was not like the man who is called God; and
moreover he gave without waiting for remuneration.... Never
at any time did I witness him asking for kneeling and bitter weeping.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a></p>
</div>

<p>But vain was the lament of the blind bard. The ideal of
the pagan hero, whose fame he vaunted, had lost its primal
appeal. It was the ideal of the cloister, incarnate in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
“saint of many prayers and many vigils,” that was now enthralling
the affections and shaping the consciences of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The monasteries as the cradle of the modern social conscience</div>

<p>In the course of a few generations the vast enthusiasm
awakened for the ascetic life covered all Christian lands with
convents and monasteries, which in their ethical influence constituted
one of the most important of the institutions of the
Church. In truth, the monasteries stand in closer and more
vital relation than does any other ecclesiastical institution
to the ethical evolution of the Western world. The service
they rendered to civilization in preserving and transmitting
to the modern world various elements of the intellectual
and material cultures of antiquity has been fully recognized
and gratefully acknowledged; but not so full justice
has been rendered them for their contribution to the moral
life of modern times. Yet it is probably true that the most
precious thing conserved by the monasteries from the wreck
of ancient civilization was that social conscience which was
generated in the heart of old Judaism and bequeathed to
Christianity. Professor Nash, in his work entitled <i>The Genesis
of the New Social Conscience</i>, maintains, and we think
with right, that the distinctive qualities of the modern conscience—tenderness
for the unfortunate, a lofty altruism,
a noble capacity for self-sacrifice—were qualities conserved
and cradled in the medieval monasteries.</p>

<p>This view of the relation of the monasteries to the moral
evolution in Western civilization may be accepted by the
student of morals as a correct interpretation of medieval
monastic history, while at the same time he admits the
truth of Lecky’s contention that there was a self-regarding
motive in Christian asceticism—it was personal salvation,
he says, that the monk was primarily seeking—which made
the morality of the Christian saints inferior to the morality
of the heroes of Greece and Rome. It is undoubtedly true
that many entered upon the monastic life from self-regarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
motives; but it is also true that constant meditation upon
religious themes, and especially the holding ever before
the imagination the ideal of the Master, who for love of
man made the supreme self-sacrifice of the Cross, had as a
natural result the deepening of the altruistic feelings, the
sensitizing of the conscience, and the moving of the will
to self-denying service for others. As a consequence the
spirit of true self-renunciation was often exalted among the
recluses of the cloister to an unwonted degree, and thus it
came about in the course of time that many who out of
solicitude for their own salvation had sought the solitude
of the cloister are later found in the outside world, going
about, in imitation of their Master, doing good, ministering
in the spirit of absolute self-forgetfulness to the needs, temporal
as well as spiritual, of the poor, the afflicted, the heavy-laden,
and the life-weary. A large part of the philanthropic
work of the Church during the Middle Ages was carried on
by the monks.</p>

<p>This humanitarian spirit, this cloister conscience of monasticism,
was bequeathed to society at large. Thus may the
direct line of descent of the modern social conscience be
traced through the medieval monasteries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new conscience condemns and finally suppresses the gladiatorial games</div>

<p>One of the earliest and the most important of the moral
reforms effected by the new conscience in the institutions
of pagan Rome was the suppression of the gladiatorial games.
For almost seven hundred years preceding the triumph of
Christianity in the Roman world, these spectacles had formed
the favorite amusement of the Roman people without having
awakened any special moral protest. Some of the pagan
philosophers and moralists, particularly Seneca and Plutarch,
had denounced them as opposed to the sentiment of humanity,
but their protest had found no echo in the common
conscience of the age. As a rule the pagan moralists saw
nothing in them to condemn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<p>It was reserved for the Christian moralists to awaken the
conscience to a recognition of the criminality of these cruel
spectacles. It was particularly the Christian teaching of the
sacredness of human life that contributed powerfully to create
the new ethical feeling as to the immoral character of these
amusements, and prepared the way for their final abolition
(404 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) through the protest made by the monk Telemachus
and sealed by his martyr death.</p>

<p>Speaking of the significance of the abolition of the gladiatorial
games, Lecky declares that “there is scarcely any other
reform so important in the moral history of mankind.”<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> One
thing which enhanced greatly the importance of the reform
was its timeliness. Just at the moment of the suppression of
these spectacles the Germanic tribes were passing the frontiers
of the Empire and adopting the customs and institutions
of the Romans. Had not these amusements been abolished
or put under the ban of the moral feelings before the final
catastrophe to the Empire, the barbarian tastes and fighting
instincts of this new race would have led to the eager introduction
of these sports into all the northern countries, just
as certainly as the humane spirit of the Greeks prevented
their general introduction into Grecian lands. When we recall
the indurating and dehumanizing effects of these amusements
upon the Roman populace, we realize the importance
and timeliness of the reform which kept the barbarian nations
free from their brutalizing and deadening influence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new conscience condemns infanticide and self-destruction</div>

<p>Equally emphatic was the condemnation which the new
conscience pronounced on infanticide and self-destruction.
We have seen in our review of the morality of the classical
peoples how almost universal was the practice of the exposition
of infants, and how slight was the moral condemnation
which the custom evoked even from philosophers and
moralists. When the practice was prohibited, usually the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
prohibition sprang from considerations of a prudential or
economic character rather than from scruples of conscience.</p>

<p>But the Christian teachers, proclaiming the sacredness of
human life and the immortal destiny of every human soul,
declared the destruction of the infant as sinful as the taking
of the life of the adult. It is to this teaching doubtless that
is, in large measure, due the existence in Christian lands of a
conscience which condemns the destruction of the newborn
babe as an act of deep moral turpitude.</p>

<p>It was the same Christian doctrine of the sacredness of
human life, along with the teaching of the duty of resignation,
that created also a new moral feeling in regard to suicide.
We have seen how the conscience of the classical peoples
in general passed no condemnation upon the act of self-destruction
if life had in any way become a burden; but the
Church taught that suicide is the same as murder, indeed a
greater sin because it destroys not only the body but also the
soul. Some Christian moralists maintained that “Judas committed
a greater sin in killing himself than in betraying his
master Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a></p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages, under the influence of the
Church, the act of self-destruction was regarded with the
greatest abhorrence,<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> and without that commingling of tenderness
and pity which with us has come to temper the
feeling of condemnation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The great missionary propaganda as an expression of Christian altruism</div>

<p>But the new conscience found most characteristic expression
not in its restraints and prohibitions but in its impulsions
to altruistic activity and endeavor. In our account of the
primitive ethical ideals of Greece and Rome we noticed how
the virtue of altruism or self-abnegation for the common good
was hidden under the guise of courage.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> It was therefore no
new virtue which Christianity brought into the world when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
proclaimed the supreme moral excellence of self-renunciation
for others. What it did was to widen the circle of those for
whom the supreme sacrifice should be made, and to give
the virtue fuller and richer content. It thus imparted fresh
impulse to that altruistic movement which we have seen to
characterize the last centuries of the civilization of Greco-Roman
antiquity. The deepened ethical sentiment found
various forms of expression, but the most important of these
was the great missionary propaganda which, during the centuries
from the sixth to the ninth, carried the new gospel to
the pagan German tribes of Europe. Lecky regards this as
the chief altruistic movement of the medieval period.</p>

<p>This conquest of the continent for Christianity was effected
in large part by men whose fervid zeal for social service had
been kindled in the quiet and holy atmosphere of the cloister.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a>
The movement was inspired and maintained by that same
spirit of self-devotion which animated the missionaries of the
apostolic age of Christianity. The declaration of the first
great apostle to the gentiles, St. Paul, that he would himself
willingly be a castaway if thereby he might secure the salvation
of others, could have been made by many a self-devoted monk-apostle
who won a like crown of martyrdom. In the romance
of Christian missions the monastic chronicles of Iona and
Lindisfarne and St. Gall, and the tales of the labors and
martyrdom of Saints Columba, Wilfrid, Boniface, and a great
company of others will never cease to enthrall the imagination
so long as the virtue of self-renunciation is esteemed
and reverenced among men.</p>

<p>This great missionary movement which brought within the
pale of the Church the northern peoples is of transcendent
interest to the student of the history of morals, not merely
because it is such a splendid exhibition of the altruistic spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
of Christianity, but also because the success of these medieval
missions meant, besides the winning of the barbarians to a new
religion, the winning of them to a new moral life; for to give
a people a new religion is to give them also a new conscience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Almsgiving and the founding of charitable institutions</div>

<p>The altruistic spirit of the new religion found a second
expression in charity, in the sense of almsgiving to the poor
and the wretched. This was not a new virtue any more than
that of general benevolence. It was never, it is true, a prominent
virtue with the Greeks and Romans, but it had always
been given a place among the cardinal virtues by all the great
ethical religions of the East. Judaism laid special stress upon
the duty of open-handedness to the poor, while Buddhism
made it a rudimentary virtue.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> Christianity inherited from
Judaism this attractive virtue and laid a fresh emphasis upon
it. Since the incoming of Christianity the poor and the afflicted
have been cared for in a spirit of compassion and tenderness
never before known in the history of the Western races.
Asylums and hospitals and charitable institutions of every kind
have multiplied in number and have been increased in effectiveness
in relieving want and distress as the centuries have
passed, until these endowments and provisions have become
a distinctive feature of Christian civilization. In the period
we are here reviewing, and throughout the later medieval
ages, gifts to the monasteries were especially numerous and
large, one reason for this being that the monks were looked
upon as the almoners of society and “trustees for the poor.”
The founding of hospitals and the endowing of infirmaries
afforded another outlet for the unbounded charity of the
age. The first Christian hospital was founded at Rome in the
fourth century by a Roman lady named Fabiola, a widow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
the ancient house of the Fabii, who also established a hospice
for pilgrims at the mouth of the Tiber.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a></p>

<p>The spirit of charity found further expression in the emancipation
of slaves, and in the ransoming of prisoners of war,
especially, after the rise of Islam, of Christian captives. Unfortunately
the teaching of the Church respecting the possibility
of possession by demons caused insanity to be regarded
as obsession by an evil spirit, and for more than a thousand
years this belief not only put the unhappy class of the insane
outside the pale of Christian charity, but subjected them to the
most cruel treatment that fear and superstition could devise.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mitigations of slavery</div>

<p>A religion or a philosophy which has for aim the reform
and improvement of human society may act directly either
upon the individual or upon institutions. Thus modern socialism
ignores the individual, maintaining that the individual
is the product of environment, and makes its direct proximate
end and aim the reform of social and economic institutions.
Through the improvement and perfection of these it
would bring about the improvement and perfection of the
individual, and thus usher in the era of equality, justice, and
brotherhood among men.</p>

<p>Now the method of Christianity is exactly the reverse of
this. Its appeal is made to the individual; it does not concern
itself directly with social and industrial systems, or with
governmental institutions and arrangements. It would reform
society by reforming the individual. When Christianity entered
the world Cæsarism had just established itself upon
the ruins of republican and national freedom, but the Christian
preachers said nothing about political liberty; the Master
had said, “Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s.”
The war system was in full vigor; after a period of Quakerism
the Church first condoned, then accepted, and finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
consecrated this heritage of barbarism as one of the necessary
institutions of human society. The gladiatorial games were
the sole important institution of antiquity which the Christian
teachers absolutely condemned as an institution, and the abolition
of which they persistently demanded and finally effected.</p>

<p>It was the same with slavery as with other social institutions.
It existed everywhere when Christianity appeared,
but the Christian teachers never preached abolition. The
Christian emperors adopted, and for two centuries maintained
practically unchanged, the pagan slave code. There
were under these rulers, it is true, some ameliorations in the
laws, due to Christian influence; thus cruel forms of punishment,
as branding on the forehead or throwing from a precipice,
were prohibited. With the exception of these minor
isolated mitigations of the lot of the slave, slavery passed
over into Christian civilization as an unchanged heritage
from the ancient world, and continued to exist as a Christian
institution until, through the action of various agencies, political
and economic as well as moral, it was gradually transformed
into serfdom. During the later centuries of its prevalence,
however, Christian teachings softened many of the cruelties
of the system, and caused, speaking generally, the individual
slave to be treated with greater consideration and humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The broadening moral movement in progress in the ancient world is checked</div>

<p>Unfortunately there were large offsets to the moral gains
of which we have been speaking. Christianity had entered a
world in which the most important ethical movement in progress
was the broadening of the moral sympathies. The genius
of the new religion, a genius inherited from the great prophets
of Judaism, was well calculated to impart, as for a period it
did, a fresh impulse to this cosmopolitan movement, and to
foster and strengthen this growing sentiment of philanthropy
and universal brotherhood. Its mission seemed to be to consummate
the work of Greek philosophy and of Roman world
conquest, to complete the obliteration of national boundaries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
to throw down the partition wall between Greek and barbarian,
Jew and gentile, patrician and plebeian, bond and free, and
to make each man’s neighbor to be every fellow being of
whatsoever race or class or creed.</p>

<p>But this spirit of genuine Christianity was soon obscured
and the world movement toward ethical universalism obstructed
and checked by the theological teaching which made
moral merit and salvation dependent upon the acceptance of
a prescribed creed. In place of the tribal and racial walls
of division which had originally separated the communities of
men and which the progress of events had thrown down, it
raised a new partition wall which divided mankind into two
great ethically artificial classes, believers and unbelievers,
Christians and pagans. In place of the doctrine of race
election it substituted the doctrine of individual election.
Throughout a large part of the Christian period “infidels”
and “heathen” have too often been to Christians what “gentiles”
were to the “chosen people,” and “barbarians” to the
intellectually elect Greeks.</p>

<p>Thus was the broadening and leveling movement which
marked the later centuries of antiquity checked, while a new
division as inimical to universal charity as the old divisions
of race and cult was created.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Augustine as the representative of the narrowing movement</div>

<p>The representative and promoter of this retrograde movement
in the moral domain was the African bishop St. Augustine.
His “City of God,” viewed from one side, is altogether
like unto the old city of man. It is simply the ancient classical
city in its early period of aristocratic pride and exclusiveness
before it had felt the broadening influence of a thousand years
of varied experience and growing culture. Only a few can
acquire citizenship in the new city. Its privileges are only for
“the elect.” A great multitude, the nonelect, are left outside
the city gates. Thus, in the words of Wedgwood, “all the
arrogance, all the exclusiveness, all the love of privilege, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
which the city of man no longer afforded any escape, found
a refuge in the city of God.”<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a></p>

<p>The narrowing and hampering influence upon the moral
development of the European peoples of this unethical system
of Augustinian theology and metaphysics it would be difficult
to exaggerate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of the virtue of toleration</div>

<p>The new division was even more of a hindrance in some
respects than the old to the moral progress of the world; for
there was not merely created a tendency to the limitation of
Christian charity to the community of believers, but there
was fostered an intolerant and persecuting spirit. The world
into which Christianity entered was, speaking generally, a
tolerant world. There were, it is true, persecutions for opinion’s
sake in the pre-Christian age, but these were comparatively
infrequent. In general, persecution in classical antiquity
sprang from some other motive than dislike or fear of religious
dissent, as we have seen to have been the case in the
persecution of the Christians by the pagan emperors of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a></p>

<p>But after the promulgation of the moral code of the Church,
which made wrong belief or denial of the orthodox creed a
fault of unmeasured criminality, toleration ceased to be a virtue
and became a vice. Thus the virtue of toleration, which
Lecky pronounces “the supreme attainment of Roman civilization,”
was lost. Intolerance became a duty, and remained
such for more than a thousand years, making a tragedy of
centuries of European history. Wars of annihilation or subjection
against pagans and infidels were waged, and the persecution
of heretics was carried on with a hatred and ferocity
in strange contrast to the unbounded charity and infinite tenderness
of the Founder of the religion in the name of which
these things were done.</p>

<p>This spirit of intolerance thus called into existence led,
during the period under review, to the suppression, first, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
the fourth century by the Christian emperors, of freedom of
religious worship; and then quickly to the suppression of
liberty of thought throughout Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> By the opening
of the sixth century no one in any Christian land could freely
think or freely express his thought, even on philosophical
themes. This retrograde movement in its ultimate consequences
was one of the most far-reaching revolutions in the
moral history of the Western world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Between moralities”; the new-forming ideal</div>

<p>Aside from the broad ethical movements traced above,
induced by the Christian conception of life and its new valuation
of particular virtues and duties, there was in this epoch
a moral phenomenon of another sort which we must now notice,
namely, the moral anarchy which characterized the later
centuries of the period under review.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter we spoke of the fusion of moral ideals
which ultimately takes place when two races meet and unite
to form a new race and a new culture.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> But as Bagehot has
pointed out, such a commingling of races is always attended
by a special danger. It is likely for a time to produce “something
not only between races, but <em>between moralities</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a></p>

<p>In the fact here stated we must doubtless look for the explanation
in part of the turbulent, anarchical character, ethically
viewed, of the period which immediately followed the
downfall of ancient civilization, and which saw the creation,
out of Roman and barbarian elements, of the new Romano-German
world. In the migrations and settlements of the
German conquerors in the Roman provinces, and in the
mixture of races which there took place, there resulted necessarily,
on the one side, a break-up of all the old tribal relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
which formed the basis of the morality of the barbarians, and,
on the other side, the destruction of all the restraints and conventions
which had formed the bulwark and stay of the more
refined, if less simple and pure, morality of the Romans.
With the old moral codes discredited, with ancestral ethical
ideals disintegrated,<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> men stood, to use Bagehot’s phrase, not
between races only but also between moralities, and the historical
ethical evolution was broken by what has been aptly
called a moral interregnum. The epoch covering the interval
between the destruction of the Roman governmental system
in the West in the fifth century and the establishment of a
semblance of social order by Charlemagne toward the end
of the eighth century, presents, according to the concurrent
view of all chroniclers and historians of the period, one of
the most appalling spectacles of moral anarchy afforded by
the records of human history.</p>

<p>In the midst of this moral chaos, however, a new moral
world was forming. Gradually, under various influences,
racial, cultural, and religious, there was taking shape and
form, through a fusion of different ethical elements, a new
moral ideal, the ideal of knighthood, which for an epoch—throughout
the crusading centuries—was to absorb a large
part of the moral enthusiasm of Christendom, and to determine
in great measure the character of the enterprises of the age.</p>

<p>Since one of the influences which produced this great transformation
in the Christian ideal was the creed and moral code
of Islam, we shall in our next chapter turn aside from following
the ethical evolution among the European peoples to watch
for a space the rise and progress of this new faith whose martial
ethics was destined to leave so deep an impress upon the
moral ideal of Christianity.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="toclink_288a">I. <span class="smcap">Religious Basis of the Moral System</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Introduction: Islam creates a new conscience in the Arab race</div>

<p>The great revolution which in the seventh century of the
Christian era agitated all Arabia and gave a new trend to
vast currents of world history was essentially a moral revolution.
It was the moral degradation of the Arab tribes, still
clinging to an outgrown, idolatrous worship incapable longer
of giving moral guidance to its followers, that stirred the
soul and inspired the message of Mohammed. The Prophet’s
real appeal was to the conscience of the Arab race. The
chief aim and purpose of his preaching was to effect a moral
reform. He gave the Arabs, it is true, a new religion, but
the religion was to give impulse and sanction to the new
morality. The transformation which the new faith wrought in
the moral consciousness of the Arabian nation was probably
not less profound than that effected by Christianity in the
moral consciousness of the European peoples. It is this
which makes the rise of Islam a matter as important in the
moral as in the religious history of mankind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of the unity of God</div>

<p>Islam may, with strict historical accuracy, be said to be
essentially a republication of Judaism. Its morality, like the
old Hebrew morality, is largely derived from its conception
of deity. It teaches that God is one, and that he is all-powerful,
compassionate, forgiving, and righteous. Allah is
great and merciful and just, is the burden of the Prophet’s
message respecting deity. This ethical monotheism has been
a governing force in the moral life of the Mohammedan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
world, just as a like ethical monotheism has been a molding
influence in the moral life of the Jews and of all those
nations that have received their religion from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dogma of salvation by belief</div>

<p>Another religious doctrine which has contributed largely
to shape the morality of Islam is that of salvation by belief.
Only the true believer can be saved. The tendency, indeed
the logical and inevitable consequence of this doctrine, has
been to make Islam one of the most intolerant of the great
religions. It has tended to restrict the moral sympathies of
Moslems to coreligionists and to make propagandism by
violence seem a virtue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An unchangeable moral law</div>

<p>Islam claims to be a divine revelation to man. This doctrine
of the supernatural origin of the religion makes the
moral code, which is bound up with it, a rigid, unchangeable
law, for it is only a human code that can be changed without
irreverence and sacrilege. The blighting effects upon Mohammedan
morality of this dogma of a moral law supernaturally
given for all time will be noted a little later, when we come
to speak of the actual moral life in Mohammedan lands.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_289">II. <span class="smcap">The Moral Code</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">General nature of the code</div>

<p>Like all the other ethical systems of Asia, save those of
genuine Christianity and Buddhism, the Islamic system lays
special emphasis upon the performance of particular prescribed
acts. It is by no means silent respecting the necessity of right
states and dispositions of mind. But instead of relying upon
general principles for the guidance of the moral life, it lays
its emphasis upon specific outer observances, such as almsgiving,
fasting, pilgrimages, and stated prayers.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> The tendency
of such a code of precise rules and commands, as was
pointed out in connection with Chinese morality and again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
in connection with the postexilic morality of the Jews, is to
externalize morality and render the moral life conventional
and mechanical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duty and virtue of right belief</div>

<p>In correspondence with the dogma of salvation through
belief, the paramount duty and virtue in the ethical-religious
code of Islam is unquestioning belief in Allah as the only
true God and in Mohammed as his prophet. Without this
virtue of correct belief there can be, according to the teachings
of Islam, no salvation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fighting for the true religion a cardinal duty</div>

<p>One effect of thus making right belief an indispensable
virtue was to make intolerance practically a virtuous disposition
of mind, and the conquest of infidels a paramount duty.
It is here that we find one of the fundamental differences
between the ethical teachings of Christ and those of Mohammed.
The Founder of Christianity, through his teaching of
nonresistance, condemned war. He commanded his followers
to put up the sword. The founder of Islam, on the other
hand, frankly and without scruple adopted the war system of
his time and consecrated it to a religious end and purpose.
His followers were commanded to fight for the extension of
the religion of Allah.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> Those who fell in battle for the faith
were promised immediate entrance into the joys of Paradise.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a></p>

<p>Never was there a more fateful provision given a place in
a code of morals. It determined in large measure the character
of Islam and foreshadowed its history. It made it a martial
religion. This martial religion, through reaction upon Christianity,
helped to make it like unto itself. Thus was prepared
the way for the Holy Wars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provisions of the code respecting slavery</div>

<p>Just as Mohammed adopted the war system he found in
existence, so did he adopt that of slavery. But while accepting
the system, he did much to improve the status of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
bondsman. The legislation of the Koran in this department
of ethics follows the humane regulations of the old Hebrew
code. In its specific provisions favorable to the slave it goes
beyond the requirements of the New Testament. It not only
enjoins the kind treatment of slaves but provides that converts
to Islam shall be set free, and in general encourages
manumission.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Family morals: polygamy recognized as ethical</div>

<p>In no department of ethics is the contrast between Christian
and Mohammedan morals sharper than in the sphere of
domestic morality. Sex relations which the Christian Church
condemns as sin, and which the Christian civil law makes a
crime, are by the Mohammedan moral consciousness pronounced
natural and right, or at least ethically indifferent.
The New Testament absolutely prohibited polygamy, although
from primitive times the moralists of the East had had in
general no condemnation for the custom; but the Koran accepted
the system without scruple. In doing so, however, it
placed salutary restraints upon the unregulated license which
had hitherto characterized the institution. It limited the
number of wives of the faithful to four,<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> and surrounded
divorce with wholesome restrictions.</p>

<p>Family ethics were further lifted to a higher level by the
positive prohibition of infanticide,<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> a practice which constituted
one of the worst evils of Arab society in pre-Islamic
times. The positive enactments of the Koranic code in this
department of morals accomplished what was effected indirectly
in the same domain by Christianity through its teachings
of the sanctity of human life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prohibition of gambling and the use of intoxicating liquors</div>

<p>Among the other prohibitions of the moral code of Islam
are two worthy of special notice for the reason that, being
made largely effective by the sanctions of religion, they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
exercised an incalculable influence upon the Mohammedan
world. These are the provisions of the Koran forbidding in
the most positive terms gambling and the use of alcoholic
drinks.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a> These prohibitions have had a great and undeniable
influence in preserving Mohammedan civilization, in the extended
reach of lands over which it has spread, from those
inveterate twin evils of gambling and drunkenness which
constitute one of the deepest stains on Christian civilization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Animal ethics</div>

<p>It has been maintained that the place given duties to lower
animals is a crucial test of a moral code.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> Tried by this
standard, the code of Islam must be accorded a high place
among the ethical systems of the world. In the department
of animal ethics it is on a level with that of the old Hebrew
Testament. Indeed, the tender solicitude of the code for
dumb animals is one of its most admirable features. The
whole animal creation is here brought within the pale of
ethics. Thus at the outset Islam took up a position respecting
man’s duty toward the animal world which Christianity
is only just now tardily assuming.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A concrete and practical morality</div>

<p>Taken as a whole the ethical rules and commands of the
Koran constitute an admirable code, one which has been an
efficient force in the moral improvement and uplift of the
peoples of vast regions of the earth. The morality inculcated
has been succinctly characterized as a concrete and
practical one. It is particularly well adapted to races in a
low stage of culture. The very fact that, notwithstanding
some serious defects and limitations, the code has been accepted
by so large a part of the human race, and has, for over
a thousand years, given moral guidance and inspiration to
such vast multitudes, goes to prove that the great body of
its rules and prescriptions of conduct are in general in line
with the elemental laws of the moral world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<h3 id="toclink_293">III. <span class="smcap">The Moral Life</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Mohammedan morality depressed by racial influences</div>

<p>In any comparison instituted between Christianity and
Islam as moral regenerators of society there is need that
the difference in the fields entered by these rival creeds be
kept carefully in mind. Islam was placed at a disadvantage
in that it went among the morally degenerate and dissolute
peoples of the Orient, while Christianity had for its field the
classical peoples and particularly the fresh German race. In
those same Eastern lands and among those same Oriental or
semi-Hellenized races Christianity had not only signally failed
morally to reform and uplift society, but in that unfavorable
environment had itself become lamentably degenerate and
corrupt. In pointing out this disadvantage to which Islam
has been subjected, a discerning Moslem writer says, “Like
rivers flowing through varied tracts, both these creeds have
produced results in accordance with the nature of the soil
through which they have found their course.”<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> There is
here the necessary recognition of the influence which the
historical environment exercises upon the moral standard.
The prerequisite of a good harvest in the field of morals,
as in the physical world, is not only good seed but also a
good soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consequence of giving a religious sanction to war</div>

<p>The whole history of Islam, as already remarked, has been
molded by the fact that fighting for the extension of the true
religion was made by Mohammed a chief duty of the faithful.
Islam’s wonderful career of conquest during the first century
after its rise was in large measure the result of the Prophet
having made war against infidels a pious duty. Hitherto war
among the Arabs had been for the most part merely a raid
or hunt. Now it was given an ethical-religious motive and
thus made a crusade. In the space of a single century a large
part of the countries which had formed the historic lands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
antiquity had been brought by the Arabian warriors under
the sway of Islam.</p>

<p>But this was not all. These conquests brought Islam in
contact with Christendom along all its extended frontier from
the Straits of Gibraltar to the Bosporus, and thus created
the conditions which led to the Holy Wars between Moslem
and Christian, which filled the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
Such were the momentous and far-reaching consequences of
the giving by the Arabian Prophet of a religious sanction to
war, and the reënforcing of the war spirit among a martial
race by making warfare a duty and death in battle a sure
passport to the bliss of paradise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mitigation of Oriental barbarities in war</div>

<p>While adopting and sanctifying the war system, Islam did
something in the way of mitigating its savagery. Up to this
time the war code of the Asian peoples had lost little or none
of its primitive barbarity. The indiscriminate slaughter of the
vanquished, without regard to age or sex, had been a common
practice. But when the second Arabian caliph, Omar, sent
out his warriors to effect the conquest of the world for the
true religion, he strictly enjoined them to spare the women
and children and the old men. This injunction became a part
of the Mohammedan war code, and, though not always observed,
it did much to make the earlier wars waged for the
spread of Islam, compared with most of the recorded wars
among the Oriental races, merciful and humane.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intolerance as a corollary of religious principles</div>

<p>Intimately related to the subject of the Mohammedan ethics
of war is the subject of toleration. As we have seen, the natural
tendency of the teaching that right religious belief is necessary
to salvation, and that fighting for the spread of the true
religion is a paramount duty, is to foster intolerance, indeed,
is to make intolerance a virtue. These doctrines of Islam
have in the main restricted to the faithful the outgoings of
the moral sympathies. To the moral consciousness of the
Moslem masses tolerance has not presented itself as a virtue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
at all, but rather as a reprehensible disposition of mind, since
it argues lack of zeal for the true faith. There is to-day more
religious intolerance in Moslem lands than in any other regions
of the earth. In this respect the Mohammedan world is about
at the standpoint held by Christendom in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>But fortunately it is the same with a bad principle as with
a good one—it never produces its full logical consequences.
There is that in the constitution of things and in human nature
which prevents this. Hence there has been in Mohammedan
lands a larger measure of toleration than, in view of the teachings
of Islam, we should have looked for. But the toleration
enjoyed by non-Moslems under Mohammedan rule has been
at best precarious. With lamentable frequency, in lands where
large sections of the population are ignorant and debased,
outbursts of fanaticism have resulted in terrible massacres
of “unbelievers.”</p>

<p>Not until Moslem civilization has felt the broadening effect
of those material, intellectual, and moral revolutions which
have finally brought in toleration in a once intolerant Christendom,
will this virtue, without which a true and progressive moral
life is impossible, find a place in the ethical code of Islam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The slave trade under Islam</div>

<p>The slave trade in Mohammedan lands has been fostered
through the consecration of the war system by Mohammed
and his recognition of slavery as a part of the established
social order. Throughout the first century of the career of
Islam the propaganda of the faith by the sword provided an
unfailing source of slaves, such as had not been opened up
since the completion of the conquest of the world by the
Roman legions.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> This religious legitimatizing of the slave
trade filled Moslem lands with slave markets, and, when the
wars of the religious propaganda had ceased, tended to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
a fresh impulse to the African slave traffic, which had been
in existence from time immemorial. This trade by Mohammedans
has been just such a curse to eastern and central
Africa as the European Christian slave traffic—which, beginning
in the fifteenth century, continued till its final suppression
in the nineteenth—was to the west African coast
and the hinterland. The Moslem trade is still carried on
clandestinely,<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> since there has as yet been little or no moral
disapprobation of the traffic awakened in Mohammedan lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drunkenness in Mohammedan countries</div>

<p>The absolute prohibition in the Koran of the use of all
intoxicating liquors has been wonderfully effective in preserving
Mohammedan lands from the great evil of drunkenness.
This vice, so common in Christian lands, is almost unknown
in countries where the faith of the Koran is really dominant
and the influence of Europeans has not been felt.</p>

<p>In Afghanistan the penalty inflicted for drunkenness is
death. So rigorously is the law of Islam in this matter enforced
that persons in a state of intoxication are almost never
seen. Nor is the evil simply driven under cover; there is
practically very little drinking going on in the privacy of
the home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moslem charity</div>

<p>Islam has been only less effective than Buddhism and
Christianity in fostering the attractive virtue of charity. The
precepts of the Koran respecting almsgiving and other deeds
of benevolence have greatly promoted the habit of giving
among the followers of the Prophet. The giving of direct
relief to the poor in the form of alms is probably quite as
general as among Christians, though much of this charity is
indiscriminate and tends to foster that mendicity which is
such an ever-present evil in Mohammedan lands. The building
of caravansaries, the construction of aqueducts, the opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
of fountains along the routes of travel, and the founding of
asylums are forms of benevolence which recall similar works of
philanthropy in the later period of the pagan Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Respecting this charity, however, it must be said that much
of it has the taint of self-interest. Many of these good works
are performed not so much from genuine philanthropy as
from self-regarding motives, the dominant thought of the
doer being to gain religious merit for himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral influence of Islam on races low in civilization</div>

<p>The spread of Islam has been almost from the first largely
among tribes and peoples low in the scale of civilization. In
the earlier centuries of its career, besides its conquests among
the peoples of ancient culture, it won over a great part of the
uncivilized clans and tribes of Asia, and to-day is making
constant and rapid progress among the negro tribes of central
Africa. What renders this fact of significance to the historian
of morals is that Islam has shown itself to be one
of the most potent forces at work in the world to-day for
the moral elevation of peoples still on or near the level of
savagery. Canon Isaac Taylor affirms that it “causes the
negro tribes of Africa to renounce paganism, devil worship,
fetishism, cannibalism, human sacrifices, infanticide, witchcraft,
gambling, drunkenness, unchastity, cruelty, and personal
uncleanliness.”<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a></p>

<p>That the moral code of Islam should be even more effective
than the Christian in lifting savages to a higher moral level
is attributed by Canon Taylor to the fact that the moral
standard of Christianity is so high that “its virtues are only
vaguely understood and not generally practiced, while the
lower virtues which Islam enforces are understood and
generally practiced.”</p>

<p>In a word, it is with Islam’s morality the same as with its
theology. Its doctrine of one God is simple, concrete, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
easily understood, and for this reason Islam is admittedly
more readily accepted by races low in culture than Christianity
with its metaphysical doctrine of the Trinity. As the
simplicity and concreteness of its teachings respecting deity
adapt its creed to the savage mind, so do the lower concrete
practical virtues of its moral code adapt it to the rudimentary
moral sense of the primitive man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects upon Mohammedan morality of an unpliant law</div>

<p>One of the most striking and instructive phenomena of
universal history is the contrasted fortunes of Mohammedan
and Christian civilization. In the eighth century of our era
Mohammedan culture was in many respects superior to that
of Christendom. It held forth great promises for the future.
But these promises were not kept. Stagnation quickly followed
the period of brilliant achievement, and a blight fell
upon the Moslem world, while the history of Christendom
has been a record of wonderful development and progress,
until to-day the two worlds cannot be placed in comparison
with one another, but only in contrast.</p>

<p>Beyond question many agencies, such as race, religion, and
government, have concurred to produce this contrast in history
and fortune, but equally certain is it that a potent contributory
cause is the difference in the moral systems which the two
civilizations respectively inherited. The moral life of the
Christian world, happily freed from the bondage of the rigid
Mosaic law, an outer law of positive minute commands, has
expatiated under the comprehensive, flexible law of the Gospel,
a law of love and liberty. As a result the moral life of
Christendom has been, on the whole, notwithstanding certain
Mohammedanizing tendencies, an expansive growth under
the guidance of a moral consciousness gradually purified and
refined by experience and advancing culture. On the other
hand, the moral life of the Mohammedan world has been
subjected to the authority of an external, unchanging law, a
law conceived to have been given for all time, a republication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
practically of that rigid Mosaic law from the bondage of
which the Christian world had fortunately escaped. But the
moral life cannot be thus subjected to a rigid external
authority without resulting inanition and death. “The
blight that has fallen on the Moslem nations,” declares a
well-informed and thoughtful Mohammedan writer, “is due
to the patristic doctrine which has prohibited the exercise of
individual judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> The ethical code of a people, like its
civil code, must be elastic and responsive to the ever-changing
needs and demands of the growing moral life.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MORAL LIFE OF EUROPE DURING THE
AGE OF CHIVALRY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_300a">I. <span class="smcap">The Church consecrates the Martial Ideal
of Knighthood</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Introductory</div>

<p>From the third to the ninth century the ideal of asceticism
absorbed a great part of the moral enthusiasm of Christendom.
During the later part of this period, however, as we
have noted, there was growing up alongside the ascetic ideal
another of a very different character—the martial ideal of
knighthood. In the present chapter we shall first make a
brief survey of the various causes that gave this new trend
to the moral feelings and convictions of the age, and then
shall glance at some of the more important historical outcomes
of the vast enthusiasm evoked by this new ideal of
character.</p>

<p>The ideal of knighthood, a product in the main of feudalism,
grew up outside the Church, and only later was
recognized by ecclesiastical authority and approved as compatible
with the ethical spirit of Christianity. Had not
the ideal been thus approved by ecclesiastical authority, and
advantage taken of the enthusiasm it evoked to promote
through it the cause of the Church, it would never have
become the significant force it did in European history.
Therefore we must first inquire what were the influences
that engendered a military spirit in the Church and led it
to approve the martial ideal of the knight and give the consecration
of religion to the institution of chivalry which was
its embodiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The genius of Christianity opposed to the war spirit</div>

<p>If at the advent of Christianity one reflecting upon the
genius of the new religion and the teachings of its Founder
had ventured to forecast the influence of the new faith upon
the different departments of morality, he would almost certainly
have predicted that this influence would be felt most
decisively upon the ethics of war. The attitude assumed by
the early Christians toward the military life would have justified
this forecast, for Christianity brought into the world the
new principle of nonresistance.<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> This teaching made the
primitive Christian community almost a Quaker body; but
barely three centuries had passed before this religion which
had entered the world as a gospel of peace and good will
had become a martial creed and its emblem been made a
battle standard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes which fostered the war spirit in the Church: (<i>a</i>) the heritage of the war ethics of the ancient world of culture</div>

<p>The causes that produced this amazing transformation in
the Christian Church were various and so interrelated as to
make it difficult to determine just what influence was exercised
by each. Yet it is possible to note the character of the
different agencies at work, and to form at least some general
idea of the way in which the transformation was wrought.</p>

<p>First, there was the inheritance from the past. War had
always been one of the leading occupations of men. It had
scarcely ever occurred to any one to question its legitimacy.
It was looked upon as a part of the constitution of things.
The ideas, feelings, habits, engendered by its practice through
uncounted millenniums of history had become ingrained in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
every tissue and fiber of man’s being. Set in the midst of
the world, the Church yielded to the influence of this baneful
pagan heritage. It incorporated with its own moral code,
wholly alien to the essential spirit of Christianity as these elements
were, the war ethics of the pre-Christian world, and thus
made this pagan international morality a permanent part of
Christian ethics.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> It will be instructive for us to follow somewhat
closely this reaction upon the ethics of the Church, first
of the war code of the civilized world of the south, and then
later of the war spirit of the barbarian world of the north.</p>

<p>The early Fathers of the Church in general condemned
the military service as incompatible with the Christian life.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a>
Not till the second century of the Empire do we find any record
of Christian soldiers serving in the Roman armies. By this time
the early rule of the Church forbidding a member to serve in
the army had become relaxed; but members of the Christian
body who entered the Roman legions were required to undertake
a prescribed penance and to seek absolution before partaking
of the Eucharist. By the time of Diocletian Christians
appear to have entered with little or no scruple upon the military
life.<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> A significant waymark of this gradual transformation
is the great victory won by the Emperor Constantine over
his rival Maxentius at the battle of Milvian Bridge, 312 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
Upon that field the soldiers of Constantine fought beneath the
Labarum, a standard which bore as an emblem the Christian
cross. The fortunate issue of the battle for Constantine seems
to have greatly confirmed the feeling in the Christian community
as to the legitimacy of war. The Church conformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
more and more positively its teachings and discipline to
the requirements of the military service. Saints Augustine
(354–430 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) and Ambrose (340–397 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), in opposition
to most of the earlier Fathers, were open apologists and
defenders of war and of the military life.</p>

<p>Thus during the very period when the Church was putting
under its ban the cruel and sanguinary amusements of the
Romans by the suppression of the gladiatorial games,<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> and
thus lifting domestic morality to a new and higher plane,
through a strange inconsistency it was first condoning and
then finally consecrating the international pagan war system
of which these sports were only a mild imitation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) The war spirit of the German race</div>

<p>After the fifth century the influence upon the ethics of the
Church of the war system of the civilized world of the south
was reënforced by the martial spirit of the barbarian world of
the north. That world was now, largely through the missions
of the monastic Church, being rapidly brought within the pale
of Christianity. But all these northern peoples were the very
incarnation of the war spirit. Their favorite deities were gods
who delighted in battle and bloodshed. Fighters these men
were, and fighters they remained even after conversion and
baptism. The mingling of moralities which followed their
conversion is well illustrated by the passionate outburst of
the Frankish chieftain Clovis as he listened to the story of
the Crucifixion: “Oh,” he exclaimed, “if only I could have
been there with my trusty warriors!” The soul of Clovis lived
on in his race. Four centuries later these Frankish warriors,
as knight crusaders, were on the spot of the Crucifixion, redeeming
with lance and sword the tomb of the slain Christ
from the hands of infidels. It was this ineradicable war spirit
of the northern barbarians to which was due, perhaps more
than to any other agency, the infusion of a military spirit into
that church of which the Founder was the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>Among the customs of the early Germans there was one
which had such a positive influence upon the evolution we
are tracing in Church morality that we must here make special
note of it. This was the ordeal by fire, by water, or by wager of
battle to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused person.
The prominent place held by this institution among savage or
semicivilized peoples is familiar to the student of primitive
society. Now the German folk brought with them this institution,
and with it the belief which made the ordeal, and particularly
the ordeal by combat, a solemn judicial matter in which
God rendered decision and gave victory to the one whose cause
was just. This barbarian conception of the wager of battle between
individuals became incorporated with the common body
of Christian ideas and beliefs. The same manner of thinking
was perforce applied to war. A conflict between great
armies was conceived as a wager of battle in which God gave
victory to the right. Thus was war consecrated and made an
agency whereby God executes judgment among the nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) The war records of the Old Hebrew Testament</div>

<p>This interpretation of the nature and mission of war was
reënforced by a like unfortunate interpretation of the records
of the Old Testament. The good bishop Ulfilas was right
when, in translating the Hebrew Bible into the Gothic tongue,
he omitted the war chronicles through fear that these records
of wars and massacres would fan into too fierce a flame the
martial zeal of his Gothic neophytes. To these terrible chronicles,
which represent God as commanding the Israelites to
wage war against his enemies, and even as ordering the most
horrid atrocities upon war captives, is due in large part the
idea so dominant even to-day among Christian nations that
God is a God of War, and that through the ordeal of battle
he gives judgment on the earth.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>d</i>) The armed propaganda of Islam</div>

<p>The transformation taking place in the ethical standard of
the Church under the various influences we have named was
hastened and completed by the reaction upon Christian ethics
of the martial ethics of Islam.<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> This new influence began
to be exerted in the seventh century. By infection the crusading
spirit of the Mohammedan zealots was communicated
to the Christian Church. Toward the close of the eleventh
century the spiritual head of Christendom, Pope Urban II,
summoned the Christian nations of Europe to arms for the
recovery of the Holy Sepulcher from the hands of the unbelievers.</p>

<p>Feudalism by this time had flowered in chivalry. The
Christian lands were filled with brave young knights, especially
knights of Norman descent, aflame with martial enthusiasm
and eager for warlike adventure. It was the ancestors
of these very men, instinct with the military spirit, that Rome
had once enlisted in her legions to fight the battles of the
Empire; it is the children of those legionaries that the
Christian Church now summons in the name of Christ to her
standard to fight the battles of the Cross.</p>

<p>The transformation of that Church was now complete.
The age of the Crusades had opened. Christ and Mars were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
co-sovereigns in Christian Europe. The teachings of the
Prince of Peace and the war spirit of the civilization of antiquity
and of the German barbarians were reconciled.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> As
Lecky finely portrays it, “At the hour of sunset when the
Christian soldier knelt down to pray before his cross, that
cross was the handle of his sword.”<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_306">II. <span class="smcap">The Composite Ideal of Knighthood</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The composite character of the ideal: its pagan-Christian virtues</div>

<p>The foregoing brief account of the reconciliation and
commingling in later Roman and early medieval times of
the pagan ethics of war and the Christian ethics of peace
has already acquainted us with what was the distinctive characteristic
of the ethical ideal of knighthood, the ideal which
resulted from this mingling of these two strongly contrasted
moralities. It was a composite ideal, a combination of pagan
and Christian virtues. The true knight, who was the incarnation
of the ideal, must possess all the admired moral qualities
of the pagan hero, and, together with these, all the essential
virtues of the Christian saint. Among the pagan virtues we
find a set of moral qualities that are attributes of character
which, with possibly one or two exceptions, were assigned a
high place either in the barbarian German or in the classical
ideal of excellence. Chief among these qualities are personal
loyalty, courage, truthfulness, justice, magnanimity, courtesy,
and self-respect.</p>

<p>The first duty and virtue of the true knight was absolute
loyalty to his superior, to his comrades in arms, and to the
cause espoused. This virtue of loyalty is the virtue which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Professor Royce makes the root from which all other virtues
spring.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> Without doubt it is, if not the central virtue of every
true moral system, one of the most attractive of all ethical
traits, and one most sacredly held from taint by every person
with a nice sense of what constitutes true nobility of character.</p>

<p>A second and indispensable virtue was courage. The
knight must be brave as well as loyal. Cowardice and
knighthood were wholly incompatible things.</p>

<p>Another moral quality was veracity, absolute fidelity to a
promise. The pledged word of the true knight was sacrosanct
and inviolable.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a></p>

<p>Still another indispensable trait in the character of the
ideal knight was love of justice. The true knight must be
just; an unjust knight could not be a true knight any more
than an unjust judge can be a true judge.</p>

<p>Again, the knight who would be loyal to the ideal of knighthood
must be magnanimous. One of the elements of this
virtue is unwillingness to take an unfair advantage of another,
especially of an enemy. It was a disgraceful thing for a knight
to attack his foe when at a disadvantage, as when disarmed or
fallen. He must always meet his enemy in fair and open fight.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the true knight must be courteous. It was as
much his duty to be courteous as to be truthful. Now courtesy
is not a trait or feeling which inspires lofty action, but one
which induces gentleness, kind consideration, and gracious
deference toward all alike—rich and poor, high and low.</p>

<p>Lastly, the knight must possess dignity or self-respect.
The age of chivalry interpreted this virtue or duty as requiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
the knight to stand on his rights as a man. He must
not let an injury to himself or to a friend go unpunished.
He must resent every insult and return blow for blow. Not
to do so argued cowardice and pusillanimity. All this was
of course directly opposed to the Christian requirements of
humility, meekness, nonresistance, and forgiveness of injuries,
and was distinctly a part of the moral code of chivalry which
was borrowed from pre-Christian or non-Christian morality.</p>

<p>To these essentially pagan virtues the knight, after the
institution of chivalry had been approved and consecrated by
the Church, must add all the distinctly Christian virtues,
particularly the virtue of right religious belief. Only the true
believer could be a true knight.</p>

<p>A striking illustration of the mixture of moralities with
which we have to do in the period of chivalry is afforded by
the celebrated religious military orders of the Hospitalers
and Templars, which were formed just before the Second
Crusade, when the enthusiasm for the chivalric ideal was at
its height, while that for the ascetic had not yet sensibly
abated. The Hospitalers were monks who, to their monastic
vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience or humility, added
the martial obligations of knighthood; the Templars were
knights who to their military vows added those of the monk.
Thus in these remarkable orders of knight-monks we see
incongruously united the monastic and military ideals, two of
the most sharply contrasted conceptions of worthy life that it
is possible to find in the whole history of ethical ideals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defects of the ideal</div>

<p>The ideal of chivalry had serious defects. First, the military
spirit, borrowed from paganism, which the ideal apotheosized,
was in absolute opposition to the spirit of Christianity,
so that the perfect reconciliation and fusion of the different
moral qualities entering into the ideal was impossible.</p>

<p>Second, from feudalism, with its sharply defined social
classes, the ideal received an aristocratic stamp. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
respect it was the direct opposite of the monastic ideal. Any
person, freeman or slave, king or peasant, could become a
monk, and by following the more excellent way gain the
homage of men and win the crown of sainthood. But the
chivalric ideal was one to which no plebeian might aspire.
Only a person of noble birth could become a knight. This
exclusive aristocratic character of the ideal constituted one of
its most serious defects. Yet in spite of this and other defects
it was a noble and attractive ideal, and one which not only
left a deep stamp upon medieval history, but contributed
precious elements to the ethical heritage which the modern
world received from the Middle Ages.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_309">III. <span class="smcap">The Chief Moral Phenomena of the Period</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the ideal of chivalry upon the history of the epoch</div>

<p>Just as the moral enthusiasm awakened by the monastic
ideal gave a special character and trend to much of the history
of the age of its ascendancy,—inspiring or helping to
inspire the missionary propaganda among the barbarian tribes
of Europe, giving birth to a special literature (the <i>Lives of
the Saints</i>), and fostering the spirit of benevolence and self-renunciation,—so
did the unmeasured enthusiasm created by
the chivalric ideal give a distinctive character to much of the
history of the age of its predominance—lending a romantic
cast to the Crusades, creating a new form of literature, and
giving a more assured place in the growing European ideal
of character to several attractive traits and virtues. Respecting
each of these matters we shall offer some observations in
the immediately following pages, and then shall proceed to
speak briefly of some reform movements which belong to the
general moral history of the epoch under review.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chivalry and the Crusades</div>

<p>The Crusades of the eleventh and twelfth centuries against
the Moslems of the East, in so far as those enterprises were
inspired by moral feeling,—and religious-ethical feeling was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
the chief motive force behind them,—were largely the translation
into action of the ideal of chivalry now commended
and consecrated by the Church. The oath of the Knights
of Malta, who were a perfect incarnation of the spirit
of chivalry, was “to make eternal war upon the Turks; to
recognize no cessation of hostilities with the infidel, on any
pretext whatsoever.”</p>

<p>It is an amazing change that, in the course of a few generations,
has come over the ethical spirit and temper of the
peoples of Christendom. In the earlier medieval time the
best conscience of the age was embodied in the monk-saints
Augustine, Columba, Winfrid, and a great company of other
unarmed missionary apostles to the pagan Celts and Germans;
in this later time the best conscience of the age is
incarnated in the armor-clad warriors Godfrey of Bouillon,
Raymond, Bohemond, Tancred, and a multitude of other
knightly leaders of the hosts of Crusaders who go forth to
redeem with blood and slaughter the tomb of their martyred
Lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Romance literature as an expression of the ethical spirit of the age</div>

<p>No element of civilization responds more quickly to the
changing ethical ideal of a people than its literature. The
change that passed over the popular literature of Christendom
in the transition of Europe from the age of asceticism to the
age of chivalry is finely summarized by Lecky in these words:
“When the popular imagination [in the earlier age] embodied
in legends its conception of humanity in its noblest and most
attractive form, it instinctively painted some hermit-saint of
many penances and many miracles.... In the romances of
Charlemagne and Arthur we may trace the dawning of a new
type of greatness. The hero of the imagination of Europe is
no longer the hermit but a knight.”<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a></p>

<p>An interesting monument of this new species of literature,
in what we may view as a transition stage, is the <i>Gesta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
Romanorum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> a collection of moral stories invented by the
monks in their idle hours. These tales are a curious mixture
of things Roman, monastic, and knightly.</p>

<p>But for a true expression of this romance literature we must
turn to the legends of the Holy Grail, in which a lofty imagination
blends, in so far as they can be blended, all the varied
elements of the knightly ideal in a consistent whole. No age
save the age of Christian knighthood could have produced
this wonderful cycle of tales.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contribution of chivalry to the moral heritage of the Christian world</div>

<p>But it is neither in the crusading enterprises nor in the
literary products of the age of chivalry that we are to look for
the real historical significance of the ideal of chivalry. Its
chief import for the moral evolution of the European nations
lies in the fact that it helped to give fuller and richer content
to the Christian ideal by contributing to it, or by giving a
surer place in it, certain nontheological virtues, some of
which the Church had laid little emphasis upon or had entirely
neglected.</p>

<p>Thus the enthusiasm for the ideal of chivalry, like the
Church’s veneration of the Holy Virgin,<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> tended to elevate
and refine the ideal of woman, and thus to counteract certain
tendencies of the ascetic ideal. It helped to give a high valuation
to the moral qualities of loyalty, truthfulness, magnanimity,
self-reliance, and courtesy. We designate these
attractive traits of character as chivalrous virtues for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
reason that we recognize that knighthood made precious contributions
to these elements of the moral inheritance which
the modern received from the medieval world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Restrictions on the right of private war: the Truce of God</div>

<p>Very closely connected ethically and historically with chivalry
is the movement during the later medieval time for the
abolition of the right of private war.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> In the tenth century, as
feudalism developed and the military spirit of knighthood
came more and more to dominate society, the right of waging
war, with which privilege every feudal lord of high rank
was invested, resulted in a state of intolerable anarchy in all
those lands where the feudal system had become established.
Respecting this right, claimed and exercised by the feudal
prince, of waging war against any and every other chieftain,
even though this one were a member of the same state as that
to which he himself belonged, there was in these medieval
centuries precisely the same moral feeling, or rather lack of
moral feeling, that exists to-day in regard to the right claimed
and exercised by the different independent nations of waging
war against one another.</p>

<p>As a result of this practice of private war, Europe reverted
to a condition of primitive barbarism. Every land was filled
with fightings and violence. “Every hill,” as one pictures it,
“was a stronghold, every plain a battlefield. The trader was
robbed on the highway, the peasant was killed at his plow,
the priest was slain at the altar. Neighbor fought against
neighbor, baron against baron, city against city.”</p>

<p>In the midst of this universal anarchy the Church lifted a
protesting voice. Toward the end of the tenth century there
was started in France a movement which aimed at the complete
abolition of private war. The Church aspired to do
what had been done by pagan Rome. It proclaimed what was
called the Peace of God. It commanded all men everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
to refrain from fighting and robbery and violence of every
kind as contrary to the spirit and teachings of Christianity.</p>

<p>But it was found utterly impossible to make the great feudal
barons refrain from fighting one another even though
they were threatened with the eternal torments of hell. They
were just as unwilling to surrender this highly prized privilege
and right of waging private war as the nations of to-day
are to surrender their prized privilege and right to wage
public war.</p>

<p>Then the leaders of the clergy of France, seeing that they
could not suppress the evil entirely, resolved to attempt to
regulate it. This led to the proclamation of what was called
the Truce of God. The first certain trace of this movement
dates from the year 1041.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> In that year the abbot of the monastery
of Cluny and the other French abbots and bishops
issued an edict commanding all men to maintain a holy and
unbroken peace during four days of every week, from Wednesday
evening till Monday morning.<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> Every man was required
to take an oath to observe this Truce of God. The
oath was renewed every three years, and was administered to
boys on their reaching their twelfth year.</p>

<p>This movement to redeem at least a part of the days from
fighting and violence came gradually to embrace all the countries
of Western Europe. The details of the various edicts
issued by Church councils and popes vary greatly, but all
embody the principle of the edict of 1041. Holydays, and
especially consecrated periods, as Easter time and Christmas
week, came to be covered by the Truce. The Council of Clermont,
which inaugurated the First Crusade, extended greatly
the terms of the Truce, forbidding absolutely private wars
while the Crusade lasted, and placing under the ægis of the
Church the person and property of every crusader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>The Truce of God was never well observed, yet it did
something during the eleventh and twelfth centuries to mitigate
the evils of private war and to render life more secure
and tolerable. After the twelfth century the kings of Europe,
who were now strengthening their authority and consolidating
their dominions, took the place of the Church in maintaining
peace among their feudal vassals. They came to regard themselves
as responsible for the “peace of the land,” which phrase
now superseded those of the “Peace of God” and the “Truce
of God.” Thus the movement to which moral forces had given
the first impulse was carried to its consummation by political
motives. To the Church, however, history will ever accord
the honor of having begun this great reform which enforced
peace upon the members of the same state, and which has
made private wars in civilized lands a thing of the past.</p>

<p>The abolition of private warfare was the first decisive step
marking the advance of Europe toward universal peace.
Public war, that is, war between nations, is still an established
and approved institution of international law; but in the moral
evolution of humanity a time approaches when public war
shall also, like private war, be placed under the ban of civilization,
and will have passed upon it by the truer conscience
of that better age the same judgment that the conscience of
to-day pronounces on that private warfare upon which the
Truce of God laid the first arresting hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress in the ethics of war: sale into slavery of Christian captives condemned</div>

<p>Although the Church has done little in a direct way to
abolish public war, or even directly to create in society at
large a new conscience in regard to the wickedness of war in
itself as an established method of settling international differences,
its influence has been felt from early Christian times
in the alleviation of its barbarities and cruelties. One of the
first ameliorations in the rules of war effected through Christian
influence concerned the treatment of war captives.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Greeks, as we have seen, under the influence
of the sentiment of Panhellenism, there was developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
a vague feeling that Greeks should not enslave Greeks.
But aside from this Panhellenic sentiment, which had very
little influence upon actual practice, there was in the pre-Christian
period seemingly little or no moral feeling on the
subject, and the custom of reducing prisoners of war to
slavery was practically universal.</p>

<p>But the custom, in so far as it concerned Christian prisoners,
was condemned by the Christian conscience as incompatible
with the spirit of Christianity, and the rule was
established that such captives should not be enslaved.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> We
observe the first clear workings of this new war conscience
in Britain after the conversion of the Saxon invaders. The
Celts of Britain were Christians, and the Saxons, after they
themselves had been won over to Christianity, ceased to sell
into slavery their Celtic captives. Gradually this new rule was
adopted by all Christian nations. No other advance of equal
importance marks the moral history of public war during the
medieval period.</p>

<p>This humane rule, however, did not, as we have intimated,
embrace non-Christians. Our word “slave” bears witness to
this fact. This term came to designate a person in servitude
from the circumstance that up to the eleventh century, which
saw the evangelization of Russia, the slave class in Europe
was made up largely of <i>Slavs</i>, who, as pagans, were without
scruple reduced to slavery by their Christian captors.</p>

<p>But the earlier rights which the immemorial laws of war
conferred upon the captor were not wholly annulled in the
case of Christian captives. The practice of holding for ransom
took the place of sale into slavery. This custom prevailed
throughout the feudal period, but gradually during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries this practice finally yielded
to the more humanitarian custom of exchange of prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
Thus in this department of ethics there is to be traced a
gradual humanization of the code, which, beginning in savagery
with gross cannibalism and torture, advances through
killing in cold blood, sale into slavery, and holding for ransom,
to equal exchange.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Morality in the monasteries: moral significance of the rise of the Mendicant Orders</div>

<p>During the age of chivalry the ideal of the knight overshadowed
the ideal of the monk. Nevertheless throughout the
whole period the monastic ideal inspired a great deal of moral
enthusiasm. The founding and endowment of monasteries
divided with the equipping of knightly expeditions for the Crusades
the zeal and efforts and sacrifices of the European peoples.</p>

<p>In the old orders of monks, however, zeal for the ascetic
ideal would often grow cold, and the high moral standard of
the earlier time would be lowered. Then some select soul,
set aflame by a fresh vision of the ideal, would draw together
a group of devoted followers, and thus would come into existence
a new order of monks, among whom the flame of a
holy enthusiasm would burn brightly for a time.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a></p>

<p>Among the numerous new orders called into existence by
these reform movements there were two which, in the ideal
of duty which they followed, stand quite apart from the ordinary
monastic orders. This new ideal had its incarnation in
St. Francis<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> and St. Dominic, the founders respectively of
the Franciscan and the Dominican order of friars.</p>

<p>In this new conception of what constitutes the worthiest and
most meritorious life, the quietistic virtues of the earlier ascetic
ideal, which had developed during the period of terror and
suffering which followed the subversion of classical civilization
by the northern barbarians, gave place to the active, benevolent
virtues. In the earlier monastic movement there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
self-regarding element. The monk fled from the world in
order to make sure of his own salvation. The world was left
to care for itself. In the new orders, the brother, in imitation
of the Master who went about among men teaching and healing,
left the cloister and went out into the world to rescue
and save others. In its lofty call to absolute self-forgetfulness
and complete consecration to the service of humanity, the
early ideal of the Mendicants was one of the noblest and
most attractive that had grown up under Christian influence.
The loftiness of the ideal attracted the select spirits of the
age—for noble souls love self-sacrifice. “Whenever in the
thirteenth century,” says the historian Lea, “we find a man
towering above his fellows, we are almost sure to trace him
to one of the Mendicant Orders.”<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a></p>

<p>It is in the exaltation of this virtue of self-renunciation
that we find one of the chief services rendered by the Mendicant
Orders, especially by the Franciscan, to European morality.
Just as the early monks, through the emphasis laid on
the virtue of chastity, made a needed protest against the
sensuality of a senile and decadent civilization, so did the
friars, through the stress laid on the virtue of self-denial for
others, make a needed protest against the selfishness and
hardness of an age that seemed to have forgotten the claims
of the poor and the lowly.<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> It can hardly be made a matter
of reasonable doubt that the slowly growing fund of altruistic
feeling in Christendom was greatly enriched by the self-devoted
lives and labors of the followers of Saints Francis
and Dominic.</p>

<p>But the value of the ideal of the friars as an ethical
force in the evolution of European civilization was seriously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
impaired by certain theological elements it contained. It was
an ideal in which, as in the ordinary monastic ideal, the duty
of correct opinion came to be exalted above all others. The
ethics of belief took precedence of the ethics of service. Thus
the friars, particularly the Dominicans, through their zeal for
orthodoxy, fostered the grave moral fault of intolerance. The
growth of this conception of Christian duty, concurring with
other causes of which we shall speak in the next chapter,
ushered in the age of the Inquisition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethics of Scholasticism</div>

<p>The ethical history of the friars or the preaching orders
mingles with the ethical history of Scholasticism. The ethics
of the Schoolmen was a syncretism of two moral systems, the
pagan-classical or Aristotelian and the Christian. With the
four classical virtues of wisdom, prudence, temperance, and
justice were combined the three Christian virtues of faith,
hope, and love. But these two moral types, the classical and
the theological, each being taken in its entirety, were mutually
inconsistent ideals of virtue. The pagan code was a
morality based on the autonomy of the individual reason;
the Church code was based on an external authority. The
one was inner and natural, the other outer and supernatural.
The scholastic system was thus an incongruous combination
of naturalism and supernaturalism in ethics, of native virtues
and “virtues of grace.” This dualism is the essential fact in
the history of the ethics of Scholasticism.</p>

<p>As it was the great effort of the Schoolmen in the domain
of dogma to justify the doctrines of the Church, to show their
reasonableness and consistency, so was it their great effort
in the domain of ethics to justify the Church’s composite
moral ideal, to show all its duties and virtues to form a
reasonable and consistent system. The best representative
of this effort of reconciliation was the great Schoolman
Thomas Aquinas. But a perfect fusion of the diverse elements
was impossible. There were ever striving in the system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
two spirits—the spirit of Greek naturalism and the spirit of
Hebrew-Christian supernaturalism.</p>

<p>But there was another line of cleavage in the system which
was still more fateful in its historical consequences than the
cleavage between the Aristotelian and the Church morality.
This cleavage was created by the twofold ethics of the Church,
for the ecclesiastical morality, considered apart from the Aristotelian
element, was itself made up of two mutually inconsistent
ethics, namely, Gospel ethics and Augustinian ethics.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a>
The saving virtue of the first was loving, self-abnegating
service; the saving virtue of the second was faith, which
was practically defined as “the acceptance as true of the
dogma of the Trinity and the main articles of the creed.”
Such was the emphasis laid by certain of the Schoolmen
upon the metaphysical side of this dual system that there
was in their ethics more of the mind of Augustine than of
the mind of Christ. This making of an external authority
the basis of morality, this emphasizing of the theological
virtues, especially the virtue of right belief, had two results
of incalculable consequences for the moral evolution in Christendom.
First, it led naturally and inevitably to that system
of casuistry<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> which was one of the most striking phenomena
of the moral history of the later medieval and earlier modern
centuries; and second, it laid the basis of the tribunal of the
Inquisition. Thus does the theological ethics of Scholasticism
stand in intimate and significant relation to these two
important matters in the moral history of Europe.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="toclink_320a">I. <span class="smcap">Determining Influences</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Renaissance: the new intellectual life</div>

<p>Toward the close of the medieval ages came that important
movement in European society known as the Renaissance,
a main feature of which was the restoration of classical
culture. Since the incoming of the northern barbarians with
their racial traits and martial moral code there had been no
such modifying force brought to bear upon the moral evolution
of the European peoples, nor was there to appear a
greater till the rise of modern evolutionary science.</p>

<p>The Renaissance exerted its transforming influence on the
moral life of the West chiefly through the new intellectual
life it awakened by bringing the European mind in vital contact
with the culture of the ancient world; for intellectual
progress means normally moral progress. Hence as the
Renaissance meant a new birth of the European intellect, so
did it mean also a new birth of the European conscience.
Just as the conscience of the medieval age had its genesis in
the new religion which superseded the paganism of the ancient
world, so did the common conscience of to-day have its
genesis in the new science, the new culture, which in the
Renaissance superseded medieval ideas and theological modes
of thought. A chief part of our remaining task will be to
make plain how the new intellectual life born in the revival
of the fifteenth century, and expressing itself since in every
department of human life, thought, and activity, has reacted
upon the moral feelings and judgments of men and taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
them to seek the ultimate sanctions of a true morality in the
deep universal intuitions of the human heart and conscience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The decay of feudalism and the rise of monarchy: court life</div>

<p>Running parallel throughout the later medieval time with
the classical revival, whose significance was so great for
European morality, there was going on a political and social
revolution which exerted an influence on the ethical evolution
only less potent and far-reaching than that of the intellectual
movement. During this period the petty feudal states in the
different countries of Europe were being gathered up into
larger political units. The principle of monarchy was everywhere
triumphing over that of feudalism. The multitude of
feudal castles, in which had been cradled the knightly ideal
of manhood, were replaced by the palaces and courts of rich
princes and powerful kings. This meant a great change in
the social and political environment of the higher classes.</p>

<p>In the first place, in these later courts there was a brilliancy
of life, a culture and a refinement rarely found in the earlier
feudal castles. In the next place, the relation which every member
of the court sustained to the prince or sovereign was fundamentally
different from that which the vassal had sustained to
his lord under the feudal régime. This relation, it is true, was
still a personal one; but independence was gone, and with
this were gone the pride and self-sufficiency which it engendered.
In these princely courts the knight became a courtier.</p>

<p>The effect of these changes in surroundings and relationships
upon the standard of conduct was profound, as we
shall see when, a little farther on, we come to inquire what
were the ethical feelings and judgments awakened in this
new environment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The growth of the towns: the workshop and the market as molders of morals</div>

<p>Three institutions—the monastery, the castle, and the town—dominated
successively the life of the Middle Ages. Each
developed a distinct ethical ideal. The monastery cradled the
conscience of the monk; the castle, the conscience of the
knight; and the town, the conscience of the burgher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

<p>What particular virtues were approved by the moral sense of
the town dweller we shall note a little farther on. We here
merely observe that in the atmosphere of the town, in the
relationships of the workshop and the market, were nourished
the lowly lay virtues of the artisan and the trader, virtues
which, though disesteemed by classical antiquity, regarded
as of subordinate worth by the monk, and held in positive
contempt by the knight, were yet to constitute the heart and
core of the ethical ideal of the modern world.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_322">II. <span class="smcap">Some Essential Facts in the Moral History
of the Age</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Revival of the classical conception of life: the new birth of the European conscience</div>

<p>When Christianity entered the Greco-Roman world with
its new moral ideal, the old classical ideal of character, as we
have seen, was practically superseded. There were, it is true,
certain elements of this pagan morality which were consciously
or unconsciously absorbed by Christianity; but the
classical ideal as a whole was rejected, just as the greater part
of the cultural elements of Greco-Roman civilization were cast
aside. For a thousand years Hebrew-Christian conceptions
of the world and of life shaped the thought and conduct of
men. Then came the Renaissance.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a></p>

<p>In the study of this movement the attention of the historian
has ordinarily been centered on the literary, artistic, and
intellectual phases of the revival, while the ethical phase has
been given but slight attention or has been dismissed with
the facile observation that the movement induced a revival
of pagan immorality. This is true. But the really significant
thing was not the revival of pagan <em>immorality</em> but the revival
of pagan <em>morality</em>. For just as this classical revival meant a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
new enthusiasm for the artistic, literary, and cultural elements
of the earlier Greco-Roman civilization, so did it also mean
a new enthusiasm for the Greco-Roman ideal of character.
To many it was no longer the Church ideal but the classical
that seemed the embodiment of what is ethically most noble
and worthy. Such persons gave up the practice of the distinctively
Christian theological virtues, or, if they still outwardly
observed the Church code, this was merely insincere
conformity suggested by prudence or policy; the code of
morals which their minds and hearts approved and which they
observed, if they observed any at all, was the code of pagan
antiquity. It is in this secularization of the ethical ideal, in
this divorce of morality from theology, in this announcement
of the freedom and autonomy of the individual spirit, that is
to be sought the real significance of the classical revival of
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries for the moral history
of the Western world.</p>

<p>In two ways chiefly did the Renaissance exert its transforming
influence upon European morals: first, by awakening
a new intellectual life, for, as we have had repeatedly
shown us, a new mental life means a new moral life; and
second, by the direct introduction of various elements of
Greco-Roman morals into the Christian ideal of character.
Thus at the same time that the cultural life of Europe was
being enlarged and enriched by the incorporation of those
literary and art elements of classical civilization which had
been rejected or underestimated by the Middle Ages, the moral
life of Christendom was being profoundly modified by the incorporation
of those ethical elements which constituted the
precious product of the moral aspirations and achievements of
the best generations of the ancient world. The conscience
of those persons in the modern world who are imbued with
the true scientific spirit, that is to say, with the humanistic
spirit of the Renaissance, is quite as largely Greek as Hebraic.
A recent writer reviewing the life of a distinguished personage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
(Julia Ward Howe) recognized this mingling in modern culture
of these diverse elements in these words: “She has
blended and lived, as no other eminent American woman,
the humanistic and the Christian ideals of life. She has
preached love and self-sacrifice, and she has loved beauty
and self-realization.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theological morality: the ethics of persecution</div>

<p>In the domain of theological morality the history of the
Renaissance affords one of the most painful chapters in
European history. This chapter has to do with the establishment
of the Inquisition to maintain uniformity of religious
belief.</p>

<p>It is not an accident that this chapter should form an integral
part of the history of the Renaissance. The spread of
heresy, which threatened the unity of the medieval Church,
was largely the outgrowth of the new intellectual life awakened
by the revival of learning.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> Hence it was inevitable that the
age of the Renaissance should be also the age of persecution.
It is not a recital of the history of the Holy Office during
the period under review which is our concern in this place,
but only a consideration of the motives of Christian persecution.
That intolerance should ever have been regarded
by the followers of the tolerant Nazarene as a virtue and
persecution of misbelievers as a pious duty, challenges
the attention of the historian of morals and incites earnest
inquiry into the causes of such an aberration of the moral
sentiment.</p>

<p>It cannot be made a matter of reasonable doubt that one
of the chief causes of Christian intolerance is the theological
doctrine that salvation is dependent upon right belief in religious
matters, and that error in belief, even though honest,
is a crime that merits and receives eternal punishment.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
dogma leads logically and inevitably to intolerance and persecution;<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a>
for if wrong belief is a crime of so heinous a nature
as justly to subject the misbeliever to everlasting and horrible
torments, and if the misbeliever is likely to bring others into
the same fatal way of thinking, then it follows that heresy
should be extirpated, just as the germs of a dreaded contagion
are stamped out, by any and every means however seemingly
harsh and cruel. Thus St. Thomas Aquinas and other theologians
logically “argued that if the death penalty could be
rightly inflicted on thieves and forgers, who rob us only of
worldly goods, how much more righteously on those who cheat
us out of supernatural goods—out of faith, the sacraments,
the life of the soul.”<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a></p>

<p>It was this theological teaching that heresy is a fault of
unmeasured sinfulness, an “insidious preventable contagion,”
which was the main root that fostered Christian intolerance
and persecution.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> The activities of the Holy Office were maintained
not by bad men but by good men. “With such men
it was not hope of gain, or lust of blood, or pride of opinion,
or wanton exercise of power [that moved them], but sense
of duty, and they but represented what was universal public
opinion from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century.”<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<p>Reflecting on these facts, we readily give assent to the
charitable judgment of the historian Von Holst in commenting
on the acts of the Terrorists in the French Revolution,
that “wrongdoing to others lies not so much in the will as
in the understanding.” The greatest crime of history was
committed by men who knew not what they did.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> It was a
theological doctrine which is to-day rejected by the reason
and conscience of a large section of the Church itself, that
caused the loss for centuries of the virtue of toleration, which
in the ethical systems of the classical world had been assigned
a prominent place among the virtues, and which, could it have
found a place in the standard of goodness of the Church,
would have saved Christendom the horrors of the Albigensian
crusades, the pious cruelties of the Inquisition, and the mutual
persecutions of Catholics and Protestants throughout the age
of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political morality: Machiavellian ethics</div>

<p>The matter of dominant importance in the sphere of political
morality during the Renaissance was the creation of a
code of morals for princes. This was a system formulated
by the Italian philosopher Machiavelli, who wrote under the
secularizing influences of the classical revival and of the paganized
courts of the Italian princes of his time.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> It was a code
which the ruling class, for whom it was designed, eagerly
adopted, for the reason that it harmonized with their desires,
ambitions, and practices, and sanctioned as not only morally
permissible, but even as obligatory and meritorious, policies and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
acts which, without such sanction, might have awakened in some
at least inconvenient and hampering scruples of conscience.</p>

<p>This princely ideal, notwithstanding that the conduct of
the prince who acted in accordance with it was generally condoned,
was not one which, like the ascetic or the knightly
ideal, awakened moral enthusiasm. It was a standard of conduct
never approved by the best conscience of Christendom.
On the contrary, the work in which Machiavelli embodied
this ideal for princes was, on its first appearance, fiercely
assailed as grossly immoral, and ever since has called forth
the severest condemnation of moralists.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle of Machiavelli’s system is that
the moral code binding on the subject is not binding on the
ruler; or rather that ethics has nothing to do with politics.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a>
With the prince the end justifies the means. He is at liberty
to lie, defraud, steal, and kill, in fine, to employ all and every
form of deception, injustice, cruelty, and unrighteousness in
dealing with his enemies and with other princes or states.</p>

<p>This moral standard set for princes by Machiavelli was the
dominant force in international affairs from the middle of the
sixteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century. During
this period it debased the public morals not only of Italy but
of every other land in Christendom. Its vicious principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
were acted upon by every court of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> Even to-day
Machiavellism, though condemned in theory, is still too often
followed in practice. It would not be an exaggeration to say
that <i>The Prince</i> has exercised a more baneful influence over
the political morals of Europe than any other book ever written.</p>

<p>It is instructive to contrast the influence of Machiavellism
with that of Stoicism. Among the good effects of Roman
Stoicism was its ennobling influence upon the imperial government.
It gave the Roman Empire such a succession of
high-minded and conscientious rulers as scarce is shown by
the history of any other state ancient or modern. In contrast
to the influence of this noble philosophy which apotheosized
duty and exalted in rulers the virtues of clemency,
truthfulness, magnanimity, and justice, Machiavellism filled,
or contributed to fill, the thrones of Christendom with rulers
whose moral sense was so blunted by its sinister doctrines
that for generations truth speaking, sincerity, regard for the
obligations of treaties, and respect for the rights of sister
states were almost unknown in the diplomacy and mutual
dealings of the governments of Europe. It is only after the
lapse of more than three centuries that Christendom is freeing
itself from the evil influence of Machiavelli’s teachings,
and that there has been generated a new public conscience
which recognizes that states like individuals are subjects of
the moral law, and that the code which is binding on individuals
is binding likewise on governments and communities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethical value of the ideal of the courtier</div>

<p>We have already mentioned the ideal of the courtier as
one of the ethical or semi-ethical products of the age of the
Renaissance. This was a conception of perfect manhood
which was nurtured in the socially brilliant and refined courts
of the Italian princes of this period. It was a fusion and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
modification of selected virtues and qualities of the knight
and of the scholar. The Christian theological virtues had
no necessary place in it.</p>

<p>It was the distinctive virtues of the knight, elevated and
refined, which formed the heart and core of the ideal. Like
the ideal of knighthood, the courtly ideal was an aristocratic
one; the courtier, like the knight, must be “nobly born and
of gentle race.”<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> Martial exploits were accounted to him as
virtues; “his principal and true profession ought to be that
of arms.”<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> As loyalty to his superior was a supreme virtue
in the knight, so was absolute loyalty to his prince the pre-eminent
virtue of the courtier. Not less prominent was the
place accorded in the ideal to the knightly virtues of courage
and courtesy.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a></p>

<p>But to these qualities and virtues of the knight the courtier
must needs add those of the scholar. The ordinary knight
despised learning and held the virtues of the scholar in contempt.
But the ideal of courtliness grew up in a land where
humanistic studies had become a ruling passion, and in an age
when the highest ambition of many an Italian prince was to
be known as a patron of learning. It was natural that, developing
in the atmosphere of these courts, the new standard
of perfect manhood should give a prominent place to the
qualifications and virtues of the scholar.</p>

<p>This ideal of the courtier was never such a moral force
in history as that of the monk or of the knight, but there
were in it ethical elements of positive value to the moral life
of the world. It was the inspiration of many of the finest
spirits of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> Of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
noble-minded Sir Philip Sidney a biographer says, “He conscientiously
molded his life on the model of the perfect courtier
of Cortelliani.” Nor has the ideal ever ceased to appeal
to the imagination, or lost its power to soften and refine manners
and ennoble conduct. It inspires gentle consideration
for others of whatsoever estate, incites to unselfish service,
and induces absolute good faith and self-forgetting loyalty to
friends and to the cause espoused, all of which are moral qualities
of high value, and all of which have entered or are entering
as permanent elements into the growing world ideal of
perfect manhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethics of industry: the medieval towns the cradle of the modern business conscience</div>

<p>In the medieval town was developed a moral ideal as distinct
and individual as that of the monastery or of the castle.
Central in this type of goodness were the homely virtues of
industry, carefulness in workmanship, punctuality, honesty,
faithful observance of engagements, and general fair dealing.
To these lay virtues were added all those which made up the
Church ideal for the ordinary life, for there had not yet been
effected that divorce of business from theology which had
been effected in the case of politics.</p>

<p>The development of this ideal of goodness was a matter of
immense importance for the moral life of the West, because,
acted upon by the practical ethical spirit of Protestantism and
other agencies, it was destined to supersede the ascetic and
chivalric ideals of life, which for more than a thousand years
had been the ruling moral forces in the life of Christendom,
for neither of these ideals of goodness could be more than a
partial and passing form of the moral life. The ascetic ideal,
having for its distinctive qualities such virtues as celibacy, poverty,
solitary contemplation, vigils, fastings, and mortifications
of the body, could not possibly become the standard for all men.
It was confessedly a standard of perfection for the few only.</p>

<p>As to the knightly ideal, this was too exclusively a martial
one to become the supreme rule of life and conduct for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
multitude. Furthermore, it was an aristocratic ideal, an ideal
for the noble born alone. This precluded the possibility of its
becoming, as a distinct type, a permanent force in civilization.</p>

<p>But the ethical type of the towns, embracing those native
human virtues which spring up everywhere out of the usual
and universal relationships of everyday life and occupations,
was sure of a permanent place among the ethical types of the
classes and professions of modern society. In the same sense
that the medieval towns (as the birthplace of the third estate)
were the cradle of modern democracy, were they the cradle of
modern business morality. Just as through the medieval monastery
passes the direct line of descent of the present-day
social conscience of Christendom,<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> just so through the medieval
town passes the direct line of descent of the present-day
business conscience of the Western world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disuse of trial by wager of battle</div>

<p>The influence of the spirit generated in the medieval
towns is seen in that important reform, the abolition of the
judicial duel, which was one of the most noteworthy matters
in the moral history of the Middle Ages.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a></p>

<p>It was the military spirit of the German barbarians which,
as we have seen, was a chief agency in the introduction of
the wager of battle or trial by combat in the jurisprudence of
the European peoples.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> Besides the influence of the towns,
a number of other causes concurred in gradually effecting the
abrogation of this method of settling disputes, among which
the most efficient were the opposition of the Church, the
revival of the Roman law in the eleventh century, and the
advance in general intelligence. Into every one of these agencies
there entered an ethical element, so that we may regard
this great reform, in its causes as well as in its effects, as distinctively
a moral reform. Thus the influence of the towns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
was essentially ethical, for the rise of these communities, as
we have just seen, meant the superseding of the ethics of
aristocracy and war by the ethics of democracy and industry.
Consequently the influence exerted by the towns was largely
that of a new ideal of character.</p>

<p>The opposition of the Church was motived chiefly by moral
feeling, the pontiffs and the bishops who opposed the practice
doing so on the ground that the ordeal by battle was “brutal,
unchristian, and unrighteous.”</p>

<p>The advocates of the civil law opposed the practice not
only because it interfered with the royal and imperial administration
of justice, but because it was a practice based on ignorance
and superstition and “incompatible with every notion
of equity and justice,” since brutal force was allowed to usurp
the place of testimony and reason. Thus the Roman law, as
the embodiment of right reason, was here as everywhere else
a moral force making for what is reasonable and just.</p>

<p>The influence of the general progress in enlightenment
was also profoundly ethical, since this movement resulted, as
intellectual advance always normally does, in a growing refinement
of the moral feelings, in progress in moral ideas,
and in truer ethical judgments.</p>

<p>By the opening of the modern age trial by combat, acted
on by these various influences, had become obsolete or obsolescent
in most of the countries of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> Strangely enough,
the international duel or public war, resting on substantially
the same basis as the private judicial duel, has held its place
as the instituted and legalized method of settling controversies
between nations down to the present time, without, till
just yesterday, being seriously challenged by the awakening
conscience of the world as equally repugnant to the moral
law and incompatible with every principle of reason, humanity,
and justice.</p>

<span class="subhead">ETHICS OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="toclink_333a">I. <span class="smcap">Principles of the Reformation of Ethical Import</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Principle of the self-sovereignty of the individual as the ultimate authority in morals</div>

<p>In its essential principle the Protestant Reformation was
a protest against the principle of authority in the realm of
the spirit. It proclaimed the right of individual judgment in
matters of religion and morals. There was in this proclamation
an ethical implication of revolutionary significance. It
was a recognition of the truth “that duty in the last analysis
is imposed upon the individual ... by himself; that there
is no authority in moral matters more ultimate than a man’s
rational conviction of what is best.”<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a></p>

<p>Of all the agencies which during recent times have been
at work moralizing morality and creating for the moral life a
permanent and indestructible basis in reason and conscience,
this Protestant principle of the autonomy of the individual
soul in the spiritual domain has been one of the most efficient
and pervasive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The principle of salvation by right belief</div>

<p>Though the chief significance of the Protestant revolution
and its ultimate import for morality lay in this assertion of the
self-sovereignty of the individual, still the full ethical consequences
of this revolutionary principle did not become clearly
manifest till after the lapse of more than three centuries.</p>

<p>Throughout the earlier periods of the Reformation era the
moral evolution in Protestant lands was influenced less by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
the announcement of this principle than by that of certain
other principles less fundamentally important, or by certain
minor modifications effected by the reformers in the body of
doctrines and practices of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Among these principles was that of salvation by faith,
which meant practically salvation by right belief. This was
no new principle in Christian theology. The Church had
always insisted upon acceptance of the main articles of its
creed as necessary to salvation. But by reason of the emphasis
which had been placed upon the doctrine of the meritoriousness
of works, many had come to believe, and to act
upon the belief, that a man is justified by what he does. The
assertion of the doctrine of justification through faith alone
had important consequences for morality, since it implied the
denial of the ethical value of works, which meant specifically
the repudiation of the principles of asceticism, on which the
monastic system rested, as well as the rejection of the doctrine
of purgatory, which afforded basis and sanction for a
considerable part of the moral code of the medieval Church.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_334">II. <span class="smcap">Some Important Moral Outcomes of the Sixteenth-Century
Religious Reform</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The reform movement reënforces the ethical tendencies of the Renaissance</div>

<p>Though the immediate results of the Reformation were
disastrous to Humanism, the ultimate effect of the religious
movement was to reënforce the true ethical tendencies of the
intellectual revival. As we have seen, the thing of deepest
import for morals in the Renaissance of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries was the announcement of the freedom and
self-dependence of the individual spirit, since such self-sovereignty
is the prerequisite of a true and vital morality. Likewise
the essential proclamation of the Reformation was the
autonomy of the individual in matters religious and moral.
It is true that the reformers, though proclaiming liberty of
conscience, the right of individual judgment, did not, as has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
already been said, at once recognize all the ethical implications
of this principle. “The Reformation,” as Dr. Arnold truly
observes, “was weak in that it never consciously grasped or
applied the central idea of the Renaissance—the Hellenic
idea of pursuing, in all lines of activity, the law and science,
to use Plato’s words, of things as they really are.”<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a></p>

<p>But the assertion of the right of individual judgment in
matters religious and moral was bound sooner or later to lead
to the recognition of the duty of inquiry, of investigation of
the law and science of things as they really are, and of absolute
loyalty to the truth when found. The final outcome
within the Church of this new mental attitude has been
the “Higher Criticism,” which is simply the continuation by
modern scholars within the reformed denominations of the
scientific criticism of the Bible begun by the distinguished
humanist Erasmus. In this remoter issue of the Reformation
the essential oneness of its spirit with that of the Renaissance
is revealed, and the ground for the assertion that the
ultimate moral results of the religious reform were a reënforcement
of the deepest ethical tendencies of the intellectual
revival is disclosed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Substitution of an inerrant Book for an inerrant Church</div>

<p>Had all the implications of the principle of the right of
individual judgment in matters of religion and morals been
seen and frankly accepted by the reformers of the sixteenth
century, the Protestant revolution would have effected at once
the transfer of morality from a supernatural to a natural basis.
But for an inerrant Church the reformers substituted an inerrant
Book, which every one should accept as an infallible
guide and rule of conduct. The ultimate sanctions of morality
were still looked for in the historic past, in an outer revelation
and an outer authority. Consequently the moral ideal of
Protestantism retained the essentially theological, supernatural
character of the ideal of Roman Catholicism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">New ranking of virtues in the moral type</div>

<p>But the changes effected by the reformers in the body of
the teachings of the old Church resulted necessarily in a certain
displacement and shifting of the virtues in the moral
type, and in a new estimation of ethical values. Various virtues
or duties hitherto regarded as essential to excellence of
character were assigned a lower place in the rank of virtues
or were excluded altogether from the ideal, while new moral
qualities or attributes were added, the outcome being what we
must regard as a new moral type. In the following pages we
shall comment briefly upon the more important of the changes
effected in several domains of the religious-ethical life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestantism brings into disesteem the monastic ideal</div>

<p>We proceed now to notice some of the immediate and
special moral effects of the Reformation. In the first place
Protestantism discredited the monastic type of goodness. The
meritoriousness of celibacy was denied. The austerities of the
ascetic were declared to be not only useless but positively
wrong. Instead of being an object of profound veneration
and homage, the saint of medieval times became to the Protestant
reformers an object of the deepest moral detestation.</p>

<p>The immediate consequences of this change in men’s
conceptions of what constitutes the highest moral excellence
was that throughout one half of Europe the monasteries,
which the religious-moral enthusiasm of the earlier centuries
of Christianity had created, were dismantled and razed to
the ground, and an institution which had dominated Christian
Europe for a thousand years was suppressed in all the
northern lands.</p>

<p>This revolution, we believe, effected on the whole a great
gain for morality and marked a forward movement in the
moral evolution of the Western world; but at the same time
it must be recognized that the destruction of this system,
which throughout a full historical period had fostered some
of the most admirable of Christian virtues and nurtured unnumbered
saintly lives, resulted in the exclusion of valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
ethical elements from the moral life of Protestant communities.
There are types of character nourished by the conventual
system that society can ill afford to spare. Very few will
dissent from Lecky’s view that “in the Sisters of Charity the
religious orders of Catholicism have produced one of the most
perfect of all types of womanhood.”<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects upon industrial morals of the dissolution of the monasteries</div>

<p>In destroying monasticism the Protestant reformers destroyed
an anti-industrial type of character, and thus helped
to clear the ground for the great industrial development which
during the last three centuries has given a new aspect and outlook
to civilization. The reformed Church gave prominence
to the active masculine virtues as opposed to the passive
feminine virtues exalted by the conventual system. Hence it
was more favorable than the old Church to the development
of civilization on its material side. It hardly admits of doubt
that in these opposed tendencies of the ethical ideals of the two
churches is to be sought one cause of the amazing contrast,
industrially viewed, long observed between the distinctively
Protestant and the distinctively Catholic countries of Europe.
It is true that the line of demarcation once so observable is
now becoming blurred, and that modern industrialism with
its ideal of industrial virtues is fast becoming equally characteristic
of all lands of advancing culture, whether Protestant,
Catholic, or pagan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects upon morals of the abolition of purgatory</div>

<p>The Protestant denial of the Catholic doctrine of purgatory,
which followed as a direct logical result of the reformers’
doctrine of justification by faith, had consequences for morality
no less positive than those that followed the denial of the
Catholic teaching of the meritoriousness of the ascetic life.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that the doctrine of purgatory,
conceived as part of a system of future rewards and punishments,
has exerted on the whole an influence favorable to morality.
But the institution lends itself easily to misuse. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Middle Ages the doctrine of indulgences was applied to souls
in purgatory, and the shortening of the period of their suffering
there made dependent not alone upon the prayers of their
friends on earth, but often practically upon the payment of
sums of money, designated as alms to the poor or gifts to the
Church. The forgiveness of sins was thus too often made a
commercial transaction. Thus the doctrine of purgatory, beyond
controversy, contributed essentially to that despiritualizing
of religion and that deadening in wide circles of the
moral sense which characterized the later medieval period
and which, through inevitable reaction, helped to provoke the
Protestant revolt.</p>

<p>The effect upon morals of the abolition of purgatory by
the reformers was immediate and far-reaching. Many specific
duties were at once dropped from the moral code. Prayers
for the dead ceased to be a pious duty; they were not even
morally permissible. Furthermore, the performance of such
good works as the making of pilgrimages and the giving of
alms for the benefit of souls in purgatory not only ceased to
be regarded as meritorious, but came to be looked upon as positively
wrong. Besides these direct ethical consequences of
the abolition of purgatory there were indirect ethical results
which we shall notice in another connection.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of the religious reform upon the virtue of toleration<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a></div>

<p>Ultimately the Reformation, largely through the outworkings
of the principle of the right of private judgment in
matters of conscience, was destined to foster the growth of
the important virtue of toleration. But throughout the first
three centuries of Protestantism, owing mainly to the great
emphasis laid by the reformers on the doctrine of the supreme
ethical value of correctness of religious belief, this principle of
the right of private judgment exerted little appreciable influence
upon the moral evolution. Holding fast to the doctrine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
of the criminality of wrong belief, the new Church like the
old was necessarily intolerant. It regarded heresy with dread,
looked upon toleration as a fault, and, whenever circumstances
favored, engaged in persistent and unrelenting persecution to
maintain uniformity of religious belief. It was not till late
in the modern period that religious toleration came generally
to be recognized by the Protestant conscience as a virtuous
disposition of supreme worth.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_340a">I. <span class="smcap">Forces determining the Trend of the Ethical
Movement</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The incoming of democracy</div>

<p>Of all the forces which since the rise of Christianity have
given fresh impulse to the ethical movement inaugurated by
the new religion, none has exerted a greater influence than
modern democracy. This is so because in its essential spirit
democracy is at one with Christianity. It is merely “a principle
which continues ... over a wider range of institutions
the same principle as Christianity introduced.”<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> It extends
the Christian principle of equality from the spiritual to the
political, the social, and the economic domain. It makes all
men equal before Cæsar as well as before God.</p>

<p>And like Christianity, democracy extends the range of persons
who are brothers until not only all classes within the
same state but all peoples and races are included. “In the
democratic union of nations,” in the words of Lecky, “we
find the last and highest expression of the Christian ideal
of the brotherhood of mankind.”<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a></p>

<p>It is this identity of the essential spirit of democracy with
the essential spirit of Christianity which makes the incoming
of democracy a revolution of such supreme importance in the
moral history of the world. To truly democratize society, as
to truly christianize it, is to moralize it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern inventions and the new industrialism</div>

<p>“The causes,” observes Lecky, “which most disturbed or
accelerated the moral progress of society in antiquity were the
appearance of great men; in modern times they have been
the appearance of great inventions.”<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a></p>

<p>In no department of morals, save the international, have
modern inventions exerted a greater influence than in the
department of industrial ethics. In this sphere these inventions
have reacted on morals in two ways: first, they have
changed fundamentally for the masses in all civilized lands
the economic conditions of life, which conditions, as we have
seen, are the great molders of morals; and second, through
the changes they have wrought in the processes of production,
and through the immense development they have given to
the whole industrial system, they have caused principles and
institutions once just and beneficent in their outworkings to
become instruments of inequity and oppression, and have
thus awakened new moral judgments respecting these maxims
and conventions. The growth of these new ethical feelings
and convictions constitute an important part, perhaps <em>the</em> most
important part, of the moral history of recent times. They
are the motive force in several of the most significant moral
movements of to-day in the industrial world. Preëminently
true is this of the present-day labor movement. “Its form,”
as Professor Peabody says, “is economic, but its motives are
moral. It is an effort—often blind and groping, sometimes
pitifully misdirected, yet none the less proceeding from the
conscience of the time—to shape economic life into an instrument
of social justice and peace.”<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> Socialism, too, with all its
ethical aspirations and enthusiasms, is in large part a product
of the new industrialism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of evolution</div>

<p>Not less disturbing to morals than the political and industrial
revolutions has been the revolution in scientific thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
effected by the doctrine of evolution. This theory has been
not only a powerful dissolvent of a large part of the body of
medieval theology and hence of that part of morality dependent
upon this system of thought, but, through the dominant
place which this interpretation of the cosmic process assigns
to the self-regarding motives, it has exercised in wide circles
of society an unfavorable influence upon morals by seeming
to give nature’s sanction to self-assertive, antisocial conduct.
There are drifts in both the public and the private morality
of the last half century which, as we shall see, find their
explanation in the disturbance of ethical values created by
the general acceptance of the Darwinian theory of progress
through “the survival of the fittest.” But we shall also see
this same theory, better interpreted in its profoundest intimations,
giving strong support to the best ethical instincts of
humanity and supplying new incentives and encouragement
to humanitarian endeavor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General intellectual progress</div>

<p>The moral history of the Western world since the Renaissance
affords a striking illustration of the dependence of progress
in morals upon progress in general intelligence. It is
undoubtedly true that, fostered by a free press, by the public-school
system, and by various other agencies, the average of
intelligence in the modern democratic state is higher than it
was in any of the states—save possibly in some of the small
city states of Greece—of ancient or medieval times. This
new intellectual life, speaking broadly, has reacted favorably
upon the moral life. It has dispelled superstition, destroyed
prejudices, widened the outlook of men, and broadened their
moral sympathies. In a word, the seeing of life and things
as they really are has tended to clarify the moral sense and
to render clearer and truer the vision of the ethical ideal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The decline of dogmatic theology</div>

<p>The body of hereditary ethical convictions and judgments
upon which modern influences have been especially at work
was, as has been seen, shaped and molded largely by theology.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Hence nothing has influenced more positively the moral evolution
in recent times than the profound modification which,
during the period, has taken place in men’s religious beliefs.
Under the influence of advancing intelligence, of evolutionary
science, of ever closer relations between the different races
and nations, and the resulting contact and comparison of different
religions, there has gone on a rapid disintegration of
old creeds. The effect of this upon many has been the elimination
from their moral code of all purely theological elements,
the erection of a new standard of moral values, and the adoption
of an ideal of character which may best be described as
being in the main a composite of Greek and gospel ethics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growing intimacy of international relations</div>

<p>The dependence of moral progress in modern times upon
inventions, as Lecky observes, is shown perhaps even more
strikingly in the domain of international than in that of industrial
ethics. As in antiquity it was the world-wide extension
of the Roman rule through conquest which broke the primal
isolation of the Mediterranean peoples and created that cosmopolitanism
in life and thought from which arose the ethical
universalism characterizing the cultured circles of Roman
society in the later centuries of the Empire, so in this modern
age it is the great inventions of the steamship, the steam railway,
the electric telegraph, the ocean cable, the telephone,
wireless telegraphy, and the rest, which have broken the
isolation of the nations, bound them together by a thousand
commercial, social, and intellectual ties, and created that cosmopolitanism
in life and thought from which have naturally
sprung those ethical feelings and convictions which form the
growing international conscience of to-day.</p>

<p>Thus it is that inventions, whose aims were primarily to
promote civilization on its material side, have become the
most efficient agencies in creating a sense of ethical oneness
among the nations, and thus in opening a new epoch in the
moral evolution of mankind.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_344">II. <span class="smcap">Expressions of the New Moral Consciousness
in Different Domains of Life and Thought</span></h3>

<h4 id="toclink_344a"><i>1. The Ethics of Democracy</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">The democratic revolution a moral movement</div>

<p>The great history-making upheavals and readjustments in
human society are moral in their causes as well as in their
effects. They arise from a divergence between what <em>is</em> and
what <em>ought to be</em>. The democratic revolution which began in
France in 1789 affirms with emphasis the correctness of this
ethical interpretation of the great passages of human history.
What superficially viewed appears to have been primarily a
political or economic revolution was in truth, in its deepest
motives and impulses, a moral revolution. “It was moral
enthusiasm for the rights of man ... and not the breakdown
of an economic system, which created modern democracy.”<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a>
The watchwords of the Revolution—Liberty, Equality, Fraternity—are
all words of moral import. They are tremulous
with righteous wrath at age-long oppression, contempt,
and abuse; and they are instinct with the living forces of a
noble moral ideal. They express the essential spirit of the
Revolution, which each day, where it has free course, finds
fuller embodiment in political, social, and moral reforms, in
humanitarian institutions and altruistic effort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethics of democracy rejects class morality</div>

<p>Democracy tends in various ways to purify and ennoble
morality, but especially by destroying all invidious class distinctions,
and thereby destroying that class morality which
through all periods of history has hampered the moral progress
of the race. All the civilizations known to history before
the incoming of modern democracy had their superior class,
including only the few, who alone were regarded as possessing
capacity for the highest virtues; and their inferior
classes, embracing the many,—sudras, slaves, or serfs,—persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
regarded as created for the use of others and capable
of nothing more than a qualified or servile morality.</p>

<p>Now democracy, recognizing “human capacities in all and
not merely in a few,” throws down the partition walls between
classes and puts all on the same level of opportunity and privilege.
It thus establishes the conditions of a common moral
life and of a progressive moral evolution; for if history teaches
any truth, it teaches that a civilization dominated by a privileged
class that uses the masses selfishly or thoughtlessly for
the enhancement of its own interests and pleasures is foredoomed
to moral stagnation and decadence—so true is it that
society is an organic body and that if one member suffers the
whole body suffers with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethical import of education by the state</div>

<p>Again, democracy has deep significance for morality on
account of its relation to education. Despotic bureaucratic
monarchy is indifferent or positively opposed to the education
of the masses because the safest basis of such a government
is sodden ignorance. On the other hand, general intelligence
is the very breath of life of a democracy. Hence the education
of the masses is the foremost task of the modern free
state. The public-school system of the modern world is the
outcome of this imperious demand of democracy.</p>

<p>Now this relation of the democratic state to popular education
has immense importance for the moral life, first, for the
reason that advance in general intelligence means a better
maintenance of the moral standard. To increase the number
of schools in a community is to lessen the need of prisons
and reformatories. More than a century ago Beccaria previsioned
this relation of popular education to crime. “The
most certain method of preventing crime,” he maintained,
“is to perfect the system of education.”<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a></p>

<p>And second, education in the modern democratic state has
special significance for the moral development going on in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
Western civilization, for the reason that it means not merely
a better maintenance of the moral standard, but also an essential
modification of the moral type itself. For in the establishment
of its system of education the state has assumed what
formerly was one of the chief functions of the Church. This
transference of the business of education from the Church to
the state has rightly been pronounced “one of the most important
movements in the history of education since the Dark
Ages.” What renders it of such importance in the view of
the historian of morals is that, in the hands of the state, education
has become or is becoming wholly secularized. In some
countries even the reading of the Bible in the schools or the
giving of any religious instruction whatsoever is prohibited.</p>

<p>Now this secularization of education results inevitably in
the secularization of morality. That portion of the moral code
which derives its sanction from theological or special religious
doctrines is neglected. Thus one outcome of the transfer of
the function of education from the Church to the state has
been the imparting of a fresh impulse to that naturalistic
movement in morals whose point of departure was the classical
revival of the fifteenth century. And thus the three
dominant movements in modern European civilization—the
Renaissance, the Reformation (in its ultimate effects), and
the democratic revolution—have all worked together in determining
the general trend of the moral evolution in the
Western world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The democratic state assumes the social-ethical functions of the Church</div>

<p>The ethical import of the incoming of democracy is shown
again in the assumption by the democratic state of the philanthropic
work of society. Throughout the Middle Ages the
Church was the almoner of society, the builder of hospitals,
asylums, and poorhouses. Since the advent of democracy
much of this humanitarian work has, like education, been
taken over by the state. This assumption by the state of these
former functions of the Church is one of the most noteworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
ethical movements in modern history.<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> What makes it significant
is, first, the fact that the work is undertaken by modern
governments largely from purely philanthropic motives. This
means that with the coming to political power of the people a
new spirit has entered into government, which means, further,
that those altruistic sentiments which it has been a chief function
of religion to foster have come to inspire society at large.</p>

<p>And second, this assumption by the state of the philanthropic
functions of the Church is significant because of what
has made its undertaking of these tasks necessary. This necessity
has arisen not merely by reason of the possession by
the state of the taxing power and hence of the means needed
for carrying on this humanitarian work, but also because of
its relation to modern science. Much of this work of rescue
and cure is dependent for its successful administration upon
scientific knowledge and skill. It is largely because the state
is in closer alliance than the Church with modern science,
and therefore is the more efficient agent for carrying on
this humanitarian work, that society makes it, instead of the
Church, its chief almoner and trustee.</p>

<h4 id="toclink_347"><i>2. The Ethics of Industrialism</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">The alliance of modern industry and science</div>

<p>A distinctive characteristic of modern industry is its alliance
with science. This union dates from the French
Revolution. One aim of the revolutionists was to put exact
knowledge at the service of the industrial arts, and, by thus
increasing the productive forces of society, to create an abundance
for all, banish poverty from the earth, and advance
civilization to a higher point than ever before reached.</p>

<p>And this alliance of industry and science has, in so far as
mere production is concerned, more than met every expectation.
Through the application of inventions and scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
knowledge to the various industrial processes, society’s powers
of production have been increased threefold, tenfold, fifty-fold,
in some arts even a thousandfold. Surely now all will
be fed and clothed and sheltered.</p>

<p>But this vision of a millennium of well-being for all as the
result of the union of science and industry has not come true.
The great mass of the world’s toilers are underfed, ill-clad,
and improperly housed. From the slums, from the dark and
noisome tenements of our great cities, arises the bitter cry of
children, ragged, wan, and hungry, robbed through the parents’
poverty of every delight and right of childhood. “The poverty
of the workers,” cries Henry Demarest Lloyd in passionate
protest, “is the sin of our age.”<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The divorce of modern industry and ethics: economic Machiavellism</div>

<p>The causes of this pitiful failure of the new industrialism,
notwithstanding its capacity for enormous production, to provide
for the wants of all is not far to seek. Our age, while
uniting science and business, has divorced ethics and business,
just as in the time of the Renaissance in Italy there was
effected a divorce of ethics and politics. Political economists
have taught that ethics has nothing to do with economics.
And this economic Machiavellism of the schools has not been
merely an academic thing; it has probably exerted as sinister
an influence upon the modern industrial order as the political
doctrines of Machiavelli exerted upon the diplomacy and governmental
policies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Dominated by this philosophy our business life has become
frankly unmoral—large sections of it grossly immoral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The breakdown of the system</div>

<p>But economics and ethics can no more be divorced than
politics and ethics. Machiavellism has succeeded no better
in economics than in politics. “The system based on [this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
philosophy] is breaking down all over, in strikes, riots, panics,
gluts, unemployed idleness, and class murder. It is breaking
down not because the task of getting plenty for the body—and
the soul—for every one out of the fruitful earth and the
fellowship of man is an impossible task, but because the task
is an impossible one of accomplishment—that or anything
else in human affairs—by the devil’s code of selfishness
instead of love, of solitary advantage instead of the good of
all. By such a philosophy there could be no government, no
family; and if it continues, there will ere long be no business.
But it cannot continue.”<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reforms whose aims are the moralization of the industrial order: (<i>a</i>) socialization of the unearned increment in land values</div>

<p>It cannot continue because there is a fast-growing conviction
of the falsity of the philosophy of economic Machiavellism—an
ever-growing recognition of the truth that the relationships
of men in business, like all other human relationships,
are conditioned by the moral law of human brotherhood.
There are profound changes taking place in the moral feelings
and judgments of men respecting many of the customs,
principles, and institutions of the modern industrial order.
There is a growing recognition of the fact that though these
conventions and arrangements may in past periods of history
have been promotive of human welfare and therefore moral,
they are, as applied to the more complex social and economic
relations of modern society, the very embodiment of unreason
and injustice.</p>

<p>Among the economic institutions respecting which there
is taking place such a change in moral judgment is that of
absolute private property in land. Although this is an institution
unknown to primitive peoples, in all the great civilizations
of the past we find society based upon it. That the
system, since it inevitably results in private monopoly, has
contributed largely to the creation of that gross inequality in
wealth which has characterized every advanced civilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
known to history, and which has helped to prepare its downfall,
does not admit of reasonable doubt. The monopolization
of land by a class has been one source, and probably a main
source, of the phenomenon in modern society of deepening
poverty in the midst of growing wealth, of dehumanizing want
for the many along with demoralizing luxury for the few. That
in countries of large and thickening population a private monopoly
in the arable land is the embodiment of a colossal and
cruel wrong is incontrovertible. That a single class should be
allowed to become the absolute owners of the soil and thereby
acquire the legal right to exclude all others from it save on
the condition that practically all that can be got from it by
the hardest toil, save just enough for the bare subsistence
of the laborer, shall be given over as rent to the holder of the
land, is as great a moral wrong as to take directly from the
worker the product of his toil by reducing him to bodily
slavery. It is this gross inequity which has made the history
of many countries, like much of the history of Ireland,
a harrowing tragedy. The wrong, if not greater, is at least
more obvious when the land thus monopolized is the site
of a great city where the enormous ground values have been
created not by any labor or expenditure on the part of the
owners, but by the growth and enterprise of the community
as a whole.</p>

<p>Just as the world has got a new conscience in regard to the
wrong of slavery, so is it getting a new conscience in regard
to this “great iniquity,” as Tolstoy calls it, of private monopoly
in land. This growing ethical conviction will ultimately
destroy the illusion that the earth and its resources may,
without moral wrong, be monopolized by a fortunate or
favored few and the great masses be dispossessed.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> The new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
conscience will decree that all of nature’s gifts in land and
all increments in its value created by society shall belong to
society and shall be the common heritage of the successive
generations of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) Limitation of inheritance</div>

<p>Another of the conventions of our industrial system in
which the moral sense of mankind is beginning to recognize
an element of inequity is the right of unlimited inheritance.
So long as land remains the common property of the community,
or so long as there exists substantial equality in
wealth among the members or families of a social group, the
injustice of this is not apparent. But after great extremes of
poverty and wealth have appeared, as in present-day civilization,
then the essential injustice of the institution is disclosed;
for there is thus created an idle class living on the labor of
others. When a single child through the accident of birth
becomes the heir of millions, while hundreds of other children
come into the world absolutely portionless and at the
same time shut out from the use of any bit of the earth even
as standing room, then the system becomes a crass denial of
human solidarity and brotherhood. And there is in this law
of unlimited bequest a double wrong. The child of over-great
wealth is wronged as well as the child of poverty. One is born
to a life of luxurious leisure, and the other to a life of unremitting
toil. Now, as Professor Dewey observes, there is moral
value in work and there is moral value in leisure, but “it is
beginning to be seen that their values cannot be divided so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
that one social class shall perform the labor and the other
enjoy the freedom.”<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a></p>

<p>Therefore the ethical demand for the modification of our
laws of inheritance in such a way that they shall recognize
the social as well as the individual element in wealth must
be heeded as much out of regard for the children of the
overrich as out of regard for the children of the very poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) Socialism: the democratization of industry</div>

<p>Still another institution of modern industrialism which has
come or is coming under the reprobation of the present-day
conscience of a rapidly growing number is private capitalism,
that is, private ownership of the instruments of production,
together with competition and the wage system, the necessary
concomitants of this capitalistic régime. These new ethical
feelings and convictions form the real motive force in the
propaganda of modern socialism. The presupposition of socialism
is that not merely ground rents but all returns (interest,
dividends, profits) on every form of private capital embody an
unearned increment, and that this element should determine
the ownership and control of capital. Hence socialists demand
that all the material instruments of production now owned
by individuals or by a class shall be held in common; that
there shall be common, democratic management of production;
that competition, as inherently unethical,<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a> shall be replaced
by coöperation; and that the wage system shall be replaced
by a system of distribution by public authority which shall
give the manual workers of the world a more equitable share
of the products of industry.</p>

<p>Socialism embodies one of the largest funds of ethical
feeling that have become active in Western civilization since
the incoming of Christianity. In truth, in its real essence
and purified form it is the spirit of primitive Christianity at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
work in the industrial domain. It is a recognition of human
fraternity. It is an effort to unite economics and ethics, to
make business life a realization of the moral ideal. The aim
of true socialists is to make the benefits of science, invention,
and civilization a common heritage. They recognize that society
can continuously progress only as these benefits become
the possession not merely of a few but of all. In the disregard
of this immutable law of human progress they discern the
main cause of the retrogression, decay, and failure of every
great civilization of the past; in its solicitous fulfillment they
find the only ground of hope for the constant improvement
of human society as a whole and the uninterrupted moral
progress of the world.</p>

<h4 id="toclink_353"><i>3. The Ethics of Modern Science</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Science and the virtue of intellectual sincerity</div>

<p>We have already referred to the influence of modern science
upon morals. This influence has been felt in the fostering
of specific virtues and in the creation of a certain attitude of
mind toward life and its ethical problems.</p>

<p>Among the particular virtues which science has fostered
is philosophical veracity or love of truth. This virtue of intellectual
sincerity is to the scientist what the virtue of faith or
belief is to the churchman. Without it there is no salvation
in the world of science. The man of science must be a truth-lover,
a truth-seeker, and a truth-teller. He must take every
pains to find out what is the exact fact, and then make a
scrupulously veracious report of what he has found. He must
be loyal to the truth at all hazards.</p>

<p>This reverent regard for the truth, this intellectual sincerity,
which is the cardinal virtue of the man of science, is
fostered in him partly by the recognition of the supreme
importance of exactness when it comes to the application of
scientific knowledge to the arts of life. The least departure
here from the truth of the matter means dire disaster and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
loss. Then also the veraciousness of nature reacts upon the
student of her laws. Nature is not only infinitely exact in all
her movements, but punctual in the fulfillment of all her engagements.
She keeps her word with us, as Emerson says.
She is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever. The careless,
unveracious man can enter into no partnership with her.</p>

<p>Open-mindedness and impartiality are elements of this
virtue of intellectual veracity. The wide divergence between
philosophical and theological morality is here impressed upon
the student of moral ideals and standards. In the ethics of
theology doubt, even sincere doubt, is reckoned as an unfortunate
infirmity, or often as positive and fatal sin. Science,
on the other hand, reckons it a cardinal duty. Hardening
oneself in belief when there are circumstances calculated to
awaken doubt, even the slightest conceivable doubt, is justly
regarded by the man of science as treachery to truth and
an unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>It is in the creation of this scientific conscience, which
pronounces the habit of accuracy, open-mindedness, impartiality
of judgment, love of truth for truth’s sake a supreme
virtue, that science has rendered one of its greatest services
to morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egotistic tendencies of the doctrine of evolution: the philosophy of Nietzsche</div>

<p>The scientific doctrine of evolution, which teaches that
life has advanced from lower to higher forms through struggle
and competition, resulting in the survival of the fittest,
has exercised a profound influence upon all the sciences relating
to man, but upon none has it left a deeper impress
than upon the science of ethics.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> Nor have its effects here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
been confined to ethical speculation; it has largely shaped
and molded actual conduct.</p>

<p>In some respects this influence has been harmful to both
ethical theory and practice. In the domain of philosophy it
may best be traced in the teachings of Nietzsche. Nietzsche
insists that man must follow the lead of nature; that the
struggle for existence must be kept up on the human plane
just as it goes on in the lower realms of life; that the strong
should use for their own advancement the weak; that the
nurture and care of the defective and weak is a crime against
humanity<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a>—for “the hope of the future lies in perfecting
the strong, not in strengthening the weak”; that only through
the struggle for existence has nature produced her highest
type, man, and that it is only through obedience to this great
cosmic law, in accordance with which the higher prey upon
the lower, that “the superman,” the highest possible type
of mankind, can be brought into existence.</p>

<p>This teaching tends to steel the heart against human sympathy
and to blunt all the finer sensibilities. It seems to
justify and excuse all kinds of antisocial action. And, indeed,
the doctrine has been used as a justification and excuse not
only of individual self-assertion and egotism but of national
and race self-assertion and egotism as well. Modern imperialism
has sought to justify aggression upon weaker and so-called
“inferior races” by an appeal to this law of evolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
as it works on the lower levels of life. Thus the doctrine has
in a certain measure fostered national egotism, and has stood
right in the way of the development of a true international
morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Altruism <i lang="la">versus</i> egotism in the cosmic process</div>

<p>But these drifts toward egotism in modern philosophy and
life induced by evolutionary science are more than compensated
by opposing movements of ethical thought created by
a truer interpretation of the facts of evolution and a deeper
insight into the cosmic process.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a></p>

<p>The philosophy of Nietzsche is a strange misreading of
nature. To say that self-sacrifice is “in open defiance of
nature,” is to overlook the dominant fact in evolution, namely,
maternity; for maternity, motherhood, is only another name
for self-sacrifice. And it is further to overlook the fact that
the principle of coöperation is even more dominant and controlling
in the cosmic process than the principle of competition.
Social animals, those in which the altruistic instincts
are most strongly developed, greatly outnumber the unsocial,
solitary animals.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> The Carnivora, those animals that live by
preying upon others, are becoming extinct. On the plane of
human life this principle of coöperation, of mutual helpfulness,
has supplanted, or is gradually supplanting, the lower
principle of competition. In the struggle for existence between
tribes and peoples those groups have gained supremacy
that have developed the strongest social instincts; that
is, those within which the principle of coöperation and the
virtue of the self-devotion of the individual to the welfare
of the whole have been dominant forces in the life of the
community. From these facts we are justified in assuming
that it is the altruistic and not the egoistic instincts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
motives that nature aims to make the permanent and controlling
factors in the cosmic evolution.</p>

<p>Again, that nature is ethical in her aim is disclosed by the
fact that she has brought forth such a being as man. Her
preferences are shown in the preferences of the being she
has produced.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> Man prefers good to evil; he loves justice
and hates injustice; he reveres the truth and detests falsehood;
he recognizes that self-sacrifice is nobler than selfishness;
he divines the final triumph of his ethical ideals. In
man—at his best—nature reveals her preferences. Man is
the answer to the question, “Is Nature good?”<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a></p>

<p>Viewed thus from a higher standpoint the cosmic process
of evolution has reënforced faith in a moral order of the
universe and has been an inspiration and an incentive to
humanitarian effort.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution and animal ethics<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a></div>

<p>In Brahmanic India and in all Buddhist lands religious
beliefs have, as we have seen, placed the whole animal creation
under the protection of the moral feelings. In ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
Persia it was religious ideas which caused one half of the
lower animal world to be regarded as sacred and thus to be
brought within the protective pale of morals.</p>

<p>Dogmatic Christianity, falling far short of the ethics of
Judaism in this domain, created a vast rift in the organic
world between man and the lower animals. The dumb creatures
were declared to be made solely for man’s use and
enjoyment. Psychical relationship between them and man
was denied, though the ancient world had very generally
assumed this. Indeed, this attitude of the Christian dogmatists
toward the animal creation was made a matter of
reproach by their pagan critics.</p>

<p>These teachings were not without their influence on practice.
Humanity to animals became a less prominent virtue
than it had been in pre-Christian times. The closeness to
nature of the lives of the medieval hermits and monks often
caused, it is true, a feeling of tenderness to be awakened in
them for their “brothers,” the birds and animals, which
found expression in many beautiful legends. But in general
the attitude of the Christian world toward the lower animals
has been unsympathetic.</p>

<p>The doctrine of evolution, however, teaching the kinship
of all life, has bridged the gulf between man and the lower
animal world, and has brought all dumb creatures more positively
than ever before in the Western world under the protection
of the moral sentiment. Societies for the prevention
of cruelty to animals have sprung up and increased in number
as in no other epoch of the Christian era. The new moral
feeling condemns all inhumanity to dumb creatures, and looks
with disapproval upon such sports as cockfighting, bear baiting,
and bullfights, which were favorite amusements only a
few generations ago.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> Hunting for pastime is also coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
under the condemnation of this growing moral sentiment.
Thus “through the portals of spiritual kinship,” in the words
of Professor Evans, ... “our elder brothers enter into the
temple of justice, and enjoy the privilege of sanctuary against
the wanton or unwitting cruelty hitherto authorized by the
assumptions and usurpations of man.”<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Import for morals of psychical research</div>

<p>It is undeniable that the earlier tendency of modern science
was agnostic and materialistic. It caused in many minds an
attenuation or an absolute destruction of the belief in a supersensuous
world and a life after death. The practical effect of
this fading from the eyes of men of the vision of another
world was, upon certain temperaments, a loss of faith in the
ethical character of the cosmic process and a consequent
lessening of moral enthusiasm.</p>

<p>This attitude of mind, which is still that of a large class,
can be changed only by the reaffirmation by science of the
assumptions and teachings of all the great world religions
respecting the existence of a supersensuous world and a future
life. It is therefore a matter of immeasurable import to
morality that these assumptions of religion are coming to be
regarded by an ever-growing number of scientists as well
founded in reality. Psychical research has given a new trend
to large sections of scientific speculation.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> It is no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
crassly materialistic. It even assumes the existence of a supersensuous
world. Thus at the conclusion of a careful survey
of the evidence of man’s survival gathered by the English
Society for Psychical Research, the distinguished physicist
Sir Oliver Lodge writes: “The boundary between the two
states—the known and the unknown—is still substantial,
but it is wearing thin in places; and like excavators engaged
in boring a tunnel from opposite ends, amid the roar of water
and other noises, we are beginning to hear now and again the
strokes of the pickaxes of our comrades on the other side.”<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a></p>

<p>Incontrovertible proof of man’s survival after bodily death
would mark the opening of a new era in the moral life of
humanity; for, in the minds of many, “ethics can be rendered
ethical only on the assumption that there is a reality
deeper than the phenomenal world of sense, truer than the
world we know and better.”<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> It was doubtless a conviction
that the future of both religion and morality is in large measure
dependent upon a firm belief in a future life which led
William Ewart Gladstone to say of psychical research that it
is “the most important work which is being done in the world—by
far the most important.” Indisputably, the reaction of
another world lying clear and distinct in the light of science
beyond the frontiers of earth would give new meaning to life
and a fresh impulse to the moral progress of the race. The
effect upon the moral life of the modern world would be not
less profound than that produced upon the moral life of the
ancient world by the incoming of Christianity with its glad
affirmation of a life beyond the tomb.</p>

<h4 id="toclink_360"><i>4. The Ethics of Theology</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">The progressive moralization of the idea of God</div>

<p>In an admirable chapter entitled “Ethics and Theology”
the author of <i>Moral Evolution</i>, after noting how religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
ideas and beliefs exert an influence on moral ideas and conduct,
remarks: “Now we are to observe that moral ideals
have, in their turn, modified and clarified doctrine, or, in other
words, that there has been an ethical development of theology,
and that contempt of creed is really the substitution of a moral
for an immoral or a nonmoral theology.”<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> The same truth is
expressed by Newman Smyth in these words: “Reformations
have grown out of the ethical protest of the Christian mind
against inherited dogmas. Old theology is always becoming
new in the vitalizing influence of ethics.”<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a></p>

<p>As a result of the growth and refinement of the moral
feelings, there has been going on in wide circles in Western
Christendom just such a change in men’s conception of the
character of God as marked the best Hebrew thought during
the later centuries of the history of the people of Israel. The
idea of God inherited by the modern from the medieval age
was an incongruous blending of ideas derived from three
different sources. There was, first, the crude archaic notion
of deity derived from the Old Testament records of what conduct
in his chosen people Yahweh approved; second, the
dogmas of Augustinian theology respecting imputed sin,
election, everlasting punishment, and other supposed principles
of the divine government; and third, conceptions
wholly inconsistent with these drawn from the New Testament
narratives of the life and teachings of the Prophet of
Nazareth.</p>

<p>Gradually, through the growth of the moral feelings, this
conception of the divine character has been purged of its
grosser, archaic, and immoral elements. The early Hebrew
ideas have been rejected as the immature and unworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
notions of deity of a race still on a low plane of religious
development; the Calvinistic idea of God has become “the
supreme incredibility”; while the Gospel teaching of deity
has been received by the instructed reason and conscience
as the only credible ideal of the divine.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a></p>

<p>Since, as we have repeatedly had brought to our attention,
religious ideas exert a profound influence on moral ideas and
on conduct, this moralization of the conception of the divine
character has deep significance for the progressive purification
and refinement of the moral life of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The moralization of the conception of future punishment</div>

<p>Closely connected with these changes in men’s idea of
God, indeed forming a part of that conception, are the
changes which have taken place in their ideas of the divine
government in the hereafter.</p>

<p>At different stages of our study we have noted how the
classifications and arrangements of the invisible world are the
work of the moral faculty, and how the developing moral
feelings of the historic peoples have, with the lapse of time,
ever modified anew the topography and moralized afresh
the government of the world of spirits.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a></p>

<p>Now one of the most important modifications ever effected
in man’s conceptions of the other world was brought about by
the Protestant Reformation. The reformers abolished purgatory,
and thus left only two separate realms, heaven and hell,
in the world of souls. But in abolishing purgatory and thereby
making all suffering in the hereafter punitive and eternal, and
in failing to recognize gradations of guilt in human sin by
consigning all evildoers, unbelievers, and misbelievers to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
same awful and everlasting torments, the reformers made still
more unethical the government which the popular medieval
imagination had created for the unseen world.</p>

<p>The gradual clarification and growing sensitiveness of the
moral feelings could not long leave unchallenged such a
grossly immoral notion of the divine government. During
the last two generations a notable change has passed over
men’s conceptions of the netherworld of spirits. The hell
of the reformers’ imagination has become, like much else in
the Augustinian theology, “the supreme incredibility.” The
blurring of that awful vision is one of the most significant
changes which, during the Christian era, have passed over
that world which is at once the creation and the creator of
human morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exchange in rank of the theological and the natural Gospel virtues</div>

<p>The advance in religious ethics during the last few decades
is registered again in the exchange in rank of the theological
and the natural gospel virtues in the moral ideal of Protestant
Christendom. During this period there has taken place
here a genuine “transvaluation of moral values.” Many representative
religious teachers have come to assign a dominant
place in the ethical standard to the natural social virtues, and
have relegated to a lower place the purely theological virtues,
such as right religious belief and ritual observances. In the
case of many the rejection of that part of the moral code
resting upon theological dogmas is as complete as was the
rejection by Christianity of the morality based on the ceremonial
laws of the Jews. With these the saving virtue is no
longer acceptance of a prescribed creed, but loving, self-denying
service of humanity.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a></p>

<p>This transvaluation of moral values within the Church itself
is one of the most important movements going on in
the moral life of the modern world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Extension to theological ethics of the principle of individual responsibility</div>

<p>Further illustration of progress in Church ethics in recent
times is found in the extension of the principle of individual
responsibility to the domain of religion.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> It will be recalled
how completely the law of collective responsibility dominates
the morality of primitive peoples.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> With the growth and clearing
of the moral sense the injustice of this is perceived, and the
principle of individual responsibility comes to be established.</p>

<p>This moral movement is consummated earlier in the civil
than in the religious domain; that is, the civil-law codes are
first modified in accordance with the demands of the truer
ethical feeling, and not until later does the religious code,
more conservative, undergo a like change. Thus gradually
during the medieval time the civil law of the more advanced
nations of Western Christendom abrogated the principle of collective
responsibility, while the ecclesiastical code retained it far
into the nineteenth century. During the last fifty years, however,
the best conscience of the Church has rejected the principle
as the embodiment of a gross inequity. The doctrine that
all the generations of men sinned in the first parent and justly
suffer for his transgression has been repudiated by the modern
instructed conscience as incredible, untrue, and immoral.</p>

<p>This repudiation of the principle of collective responsibility
by the ethics of religion harmonizes in this respect Church
morality with the morality of the civil codes of the civilized
world, and marks the consummation of an ethical evolution
which, commencing in the dawn of civilization, covers all the
millenniums of human history.</p>

<h4 id="toclink_364"><i>5. Social Ethics: the New Social Conscience</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) As manifested in the history of the African slave trade</div>

<p>By the phrase “social conscience,” as we shall use it here,
we mean those ethical feelings and judgments which cover
the relations of master and slave and the relations of society
to its unfortunate and erring members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span></p>

<p>In the entire history of the moral evolution of humanity
there is no chapter which reveals so plainly the upward trend
of the ethical movement in civilization as that which tells the
story of the beginnings and the final suppression of the African
slave trade, and of the rise and fall of the institution of
negro slavery among Christian peoples.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> Restricting our survey
for the moment to the slave trade as distinct from slavery,
the amazing fact which meets us here at the outset is that
until late in the modern period the peoples of Western Christendom
had practically no conscience whatsoever in regard to
the African slave trade, and this notwithstanding that the
conscience of the age was in many other matters true and
sensitive. The whole subject lay practically outside the realm
of morals. The slave trade was looked upon as a perfectly
legitimate business.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> Practically no one thought it wrong to
go to Africa, kidnap or purchase a shipload of the natives,
bring them in stifling holds—where sometimes half the unhappy
victims died on the passage—to the West Indies or to
the Spanish and English mainland of the Americas and sell
them as slaves.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> What little opposition to the traffic existed,
arose in general from other than feelings of moral disapproval.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<p>The movement for the abolition of the trade constitutes an
important phase of the social and moral life, particularly of
England and of the English colonies in America, during the
latter part of the eighteenth century and the earlier part of
the nineteenth. In England the wave of humanitarian feeling
which swept away the obstacles set in the way of the
abolition of the traffic by selfish interests was raised by the
great religious revival led by Whitefield and the Wesleys.
The leaders of the reform were Thomas Clarkson and William
Wilberforce. After twenty years of agitation a bill was passed
abolishing the trade (1807). This marked as great a moral
victory as ever was won in the English Parliament, for it was
the aroused moral sentiment of the nation which was the main
force that carried the reform measure through the Houses.</p>

<p>In America there had arisen among the Quakers of Pennsylvania,
even before the Revolution, a protest against the
trade on purely moral grounds. By the time the Federal
Convention met in 1787 sufficient sentiment had been developed
in the matter to secure the adoption of a provision
in the Constitution to the effect that the importation of slaves
should cease in 1808. From that year on, the slave trade, as
distinct from slavery, was under the ban both of the law and
of the public conscience; but it continued to be carried on
clandestinely until the Civil War.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) As manifested in the antislavery movement</div>

<p>Even before the consummation of the movement for the
suppression of the negro slave trade there had sprung up an
agitation for the suppression of the negro-slave system itself.
England abolished slavery in her colonies in 1833, paying
£20,000,000 for the emancipation of 800,000 slaves in her
West India possessions. In the United States there was
very little antislavery feeling prior to 1830.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> At that time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
the great majority of the peoples of the Northern as well
as of the Southern states, if they did not look upon negro
slavery as wholly proper and right, at least regarded as
reprehensible any interference with the institution where
established. Even the Church in general denounced the abolitionists
as infidels and pronounced their conduct fanatical
and wicked.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> But notwithstanding this opposition the abolition
movement and the movement for the restriction of slavery
to the states where already established gained impetus
steadily, and the heated debate led up quickly to the Civil War.</p>

<p>The most significant thing in that passage of our history
is not the revolt of the South, but the revolt of the conscience
of the North. Had there been no moral revolt in the North,
there would have been no slaveholders’ revolt in the South.</p>

<p>The development of moral feeling respecting the wrongfulness
of slavery did not cease with the emancipation of the
slaves as a result of the Civil War. Indeed, with the reform
an accomplished fact, the clarification of the moral sense of
the people has gone on uninterruptedly until a gulf has come
to separate the present-day conscience of the great majority
of the instructed and thinking classes in both sections of the
Union from the conscience of the same classes one or two
generations ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) As manifested in society’s treatment of its unfortunate and delinquent members</div>

<p>The record of society’s treatment of its dependent and erring
members forms another inspiring chapter in the history
of the growth of the new social conscience. In a little over
one hundred years the Christian world has advanced from
harsh vagrant laws to associated charities; from the burning
of witches to asylums for the insane; from noisome dungeons
to penitentiaries and institutions of rescue and correction.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a>
The numerous and costly private and public institutions established
and maintained by the new humanitarian sentiment
is one of the most distinctive characteristics, ethically viewed,
of modern civilization. So multiform are the expressions of
this new spirit that it is impossible in so brief a survey as
the present to exhibit in more than barest outline this phase
of the ethical evolution.</p>

<p>The recent history of charity, taken in the sense of relief
given to the poor, is a record of change both in motive and
method. There has always been a great deal of almsgiving
in the world, since this has been a duty especially enjoined
by religion. But because charity has had this religious motive,
it has often been sullied by self-love, alms being given not so
much for the sake of the poor as for the benefit of the soul of
the donor. In recent times this religious motive has become
less operative, but the amount of almsgiving has undoubtedly
increased, and we are justified in the conclusion that it is
motived as never before by genuine altruistic feeling. It
is probably true, however, that there is less indiscriminate,
emotional almsgiving now than formerly. But there is greater
“social compunction,” a deeper sense of society’s responsibility
for the existence of poverty, and an earnest inquiry
respecting the primary social causes of it. Hence effort is
directed not merely to the immediate relief of want and
misery through organized charity, but to the cure of poverty
through the removal of the causes of destitution. At this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
point the investigations and labors of the philanthropist
merge with those of the sociologist, the economist, and
the statesman.</p>

<p>In society’s treatment of the defective and the insane, as
compared with its treatment of these same classes scarcely
more than a century ago, is registered an ethical progress
truly remarkable. A hundred years or less ago in England
and in all the European countries the idiot and the oddly
formed human prodigy were exhibited to afford amusement
to the people. The growth in humanitarian feeling has rendered
all this a thing of the past. “The passing of the freak
is not a casual incident in the history of the circus, but a
striking illustration of the tendency which has been in progress
for centuries toward the humanizing of our amusements....
To spend a merry afternoon at the madhouse watching
the antics of the maniacs in their chains seemed natural and
reasonable to civilized Englishmen not so many generations
ago. It has become absolutely unthinkable.”<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> The history
of the stage offers like testimony. “Not so very long ago,”
writes David Belasco, in giving advice to the amateur playwright,
“the entrance of a cripple or a hunchback was
sufficient to get a laugh from the audience. In these humanitarian
times there is no fun to be made out of physical
deformity.”<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a></p>

<p>But it is in society’s treatment of the criminal class that
there is to be traced the greatest progress in humanitarianism.
In the pre-Norman period in England the punishments for
crime were characterized by a barbarity incredibly callous.
“Men branded on the forehead, without hands, without feet,
without tongues, lived as an example of the danger which
attended the commission of petty crimes, and as a warning to
all who had the misfortune of holding no higher position than
that of a churl.... The eyes were plucked out; the nose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
the ears, and the upper lips were cut off; the scalp was torn
away; and sometimes even, there is reason to believe, the
whole body was flayed alive.”<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a></p>

<p>What was true of English law was true of the laws of
every other European country. And there was little or no
essential amelioration of these savage law systems before
the last quarter of the eighteenth century. Seventy thousand
executions took place in England during the reign of
Henry VIII.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> “In the reign of William III there does not
appear to have been any consciousness that the penal laws
were, in many respects, disgraceful to any community but a
tribe of savages.”<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a></p>

<p>If a definite point of departure of the movement for the
humanizing of the criminal laws of Europe and the putting
of the treatment of criminals on an ethical basis be sought,
it will be found in the life and writings of the Italian jurist
Beccaria,<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> who maintained that the effect of cruel punishments
is to increase crime by indurating the sensibilities of
the people.<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a></p>

<p>A great impulse to the humanitarian movement initiated
by Beccaria was given by the devoted labors of the great philanthropist
John Howard (1726–1790), who, with his eyes
opened to the awful conditions of prison life through official
connection with Bedford jail, where Bunyan dreamed, spent
his life in visiting all lands inspecting prisons and jails and
dungeons and lazar houses, and “taking the gauge and
dimension of misery, depression, and contempt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span></p>

<p>The crusade of John Howard marks the real beginning
of practical prison reform, which has “transformed prisons
from hells into hospitals for recovery,” and revolutionized
the entire theory and administration of judicial punishment.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a>
The aim and purpose of the modern penitentiary system is
to develop self-respect and manhood.<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> To this end the lock-step
and striped clothing have been abolished in many prisons,
and along with them all cruel and humiliating punishments.
The establishment of reform schools, reformatories, and penitentiaries,
the introduction of the indeterminate sentence, the
proposed creation of courts of rehabilitation, and the founding
of the juvenile court,<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> mark the ethical advance which
the last century has witnessed in this domain.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a></p>

<h4 id="toclink_371"><i>6. International Ethics: the New International Conscience</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">The development of international morality foreshadowed by the earlier development of intranational morality</div>

<p>One of the most significant of phylogenetic laws is formulated
by Haeckel in these words: “The short, quick history
of an individual organism is a compressed story of the
long, slow history of the species to which the organism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
belongs.” Now this law holds good for the history of the
human species as well as for that of the lower tribes of life.
And here it embraces not only the history of the bodily
but also that of the psychical development. Consequently
the law under which the moral evolution of man is going on
may be stated in this way: The history of the development
of conscience within a social group (clan, tribe, nation) is a
compressed story of the long, slow history of the development
of conscience in humanity at large, that is to say, between
the groups composing the human race. And since law codes,
private and public, are essentially embodiments of the growing
and clarifying conscience, this mode of the ethical evolution
may be expressed in strictly juristic terms as follows:
“The development of international law follows step by step
the earlier development of municipal law.”<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a></p>

<p>With this law in mind we may define moral progress in
the international domain as the gradual assimilation of international
to intranational ethics, or, in other words, the growing
conformity of the standard of public morality to that of
private morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The gradual moralizing of the relations of the advanced to the backward races: <i>The White Man’s Burden</i></div>

<p>As thus defined, a special expression of progress in international
morality is found in the growing recognition by governments
that the obligations of the strong toward the weak
are the same for nations as for individuals. A public conscience
that is like the best private conscience is constantly
becoming more and more a regulative force in the relations
of the superior to the inferior races.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> Unhappily that exploitation
of the weaker by the stronger races, which makes up so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
large a part of the history of the past ages, still goes on; but
it is, in general, less grossly unethical than ever before, while
with each succeeding generation the protest of the common
conscience of the civilized world against all unfair and oppressive
treatment of the backward by the more advanced races
grows more earnest and insistent.</p>

<p>Good illustrations of this quickening of the public conscience
are found in England’s dealings with India and
China. In the year 1813 a resolution declaring that England’s
first duty in legislating for India was to promote the
interests of the people of India was proposed in Parliament,
but was defeated. Twenty years later (in 1833) this principle
was definitely embodied in a Government of India Act.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> In
1841–1842 England, at the end of what has been justly characterized
as “one of the most dishonorable and detestable wars
that ever stained her annals,” compelled China to keep her
ports open to the iniquitous opium traffic. Two generations
later (in 1906) the House of Commons by resolution unanimously
declared the Indian opium trade with China to be
“morally indefensible,” and requested the Government to
bring it to a speedy end.<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> Five years later England entered
into an agreement with China, according to the terms of
which the importation of Indian opium into China will cease
on or before 1917. This is a notable triumph of the new
international conscience.</p>

<p>Our dealings with the island of Cuba since its liberation—opinions
may differ in regard to the rightness of our original
act of intervention—affords another encouraging illustration
of the progress the world has made in international morality.
And the same is true of our dealings with the Filipinos,
notwithstanding the utterly painful character of the earlier
chapters of the story. There has been no responsible official<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
utterance on this subject that has represented our task in
our acquired dependency as other than a public trust, as a
guardianship to be exercised solely in the interest of the
Filipinos as the nation’s wards. The better moral feeling
of the nation, intensified in many by deep compunction, has
indignantly repudiated all those unofficial utterances which
have cynically represented the islands as an inviting field for
selfish exploitation by American capitalists, and has demanded
that our government in the islands should be inspired and
controlled by the spirit of unselfish service. And this ethical
spirit has in general marked our administration of the affairs
of the islanders. “I believe that I am speaking with historic
accuracy and impartiality,” declares ex-President Roosevelt,
“when I say that the American treatment of and attitude
toward the Filipino people, in its combination of disinterested
ethical purpose and sound common sense, marks a new and
long stride forward in advance of all steps that have hitherto
been taken along the path of wise and proper treatment of
weaker by stronger races.” This ethical purpose is especially
manifested in the sending out, in the early period of our rule,
of five hundred young American teachers to carry to this
deeply wronged people the best we have to give—a national
act without a parallel in all the history of the past.</p>

<p>It inspires hope in the future to note how far this last step
forward carries us away from the starting point on this line
of ethical advance. At first the fate of the weaker race was
extermination or slavery; then its fate was to be reduced
to the condition of a tributary; still later, to be subjected
to commercial and industrial exploitation by the conquering
people; and lastly, to be made, in theory if not yet in actual
practice, the beneficiaries of a benevolent self-sacrificing
service, which finds lofty expression in Kipling’s <i>The White
Man’s Burden</i>:</p>

<p>This sentiment would scarcely have found any such response
in the common heart and conscience of any past age
of human history as it finds in the heart and conscience of
our own. But, it must be admitted, the sentiment embodies
an ideal yet to be realized, rather than something already
attained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress in war ethics: Hugo Grotius</div>

<p>But it is in the changes effected in men’s feelings respecting
what is morally permissible in warfare that is to be observed
the most encouraging progress in international ethics in modern
times. This progressive clarification of the moral consciousness
may be distinctly traced from the close of the Thirty
Years’ War in Germany. In no period of Christian history
had war been waged with greater ferocity or with greater
contempt of moral rules than during the so-called religious
wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. What little
gains had been made in the humanization of war during
preceding eras seem to have been lost.</p>

<p>This barbarizing of war, however, produced, as all retrogressions
in morality do if the moral life is still on the whole
virile and sound, a reaction which found expression in the
epoch-making work, <i>De Jure Belli et Pacis</i>, by the distinguished
Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a>—a work that has been
pronounced “the most beneficent of all volumes ever written
not claiming divine inspiration.”<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> The aim of Grotius was
not to abolish war,—he did not think universal peace an
attainable ideal,—but simply to moderate its excesses and
lessen its atrocities, to set limits to the rights of the victor.
The age of nationalism had come, and an ethics for nations
in their mutual relations must be formulated. Grotius sought
a law that all would recognize as binding. The law to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
he appealed was the Stoic Law of Nature.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> As the Stoics
had made this law the instrument for the reform of the Roman
civil law, so now would Grotius make it the instrument for
the reform of the laws of war.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a></p>

<p>The influence of the work of Grotius was profound and
widespread. From the time of its appearance dates a new
departure in the humanization of war, and a fresh moral advance
in international law.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> “His ideas,” says Dr. Andrew
D. White, “found their way into current discussion, into systems
of law, into treaties; and as generations rolled by, the
world began to find itself, it hardly knew how, less and less
cruel, until men looked back on war as practiced in his time
as upon a hideous dream—doubtless much as men in future
generations will look back upon the wars of our times.”<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a></p>

<p>The humane provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1864
and the establishment of the Red Cross Society, which
on the field of battle cares without discrimination for the
stricken, are inspiring illustrations of the growth of this new
humanitarianism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Movement for the abolition of war&#8203;— &#8203;a moral issue</div>

<p>Now this growing sensitiveness of the public conscience
which has effected so many mitigations of the barbarities of
war has resulted in a widespread and insistent demand that
war between civilized nations shall not merely be humanized
but that it shall be abolished, that disputes between nations
shall be settled as disputes between individuals are settled—by
courts of justice.</p>

<p>Without doubt many influences, political, social, and economic,<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a>
have concurred in creating this great world-wide movement,
and in calling into existence the Hague Conferences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
and the international and national peace congresses of the
last decade or two; but among all these forces and motives
the one of greatest potency is the awakened and instructed
conscience of the world in regard to the criminality of war as
an established and legalized method of settling controversies
between civilized nations. It is this new conscience and not
the new dreadnought to which we must look to abolish war
and to keep it abolished. For, like the question of slavery
two generations ago, this question of war has become a moral
issue, and, like the slavery question, it will give the world no
rest until settled in accordance with the demands of the new
conscience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">War an abrogation of the ordinary moral code</div>

<p>Especially intolerable to the more sensitive conscience of
to-day is the assumption that nations may at will suspend or
abrogate the ordinary moral code. For, as Lord Morley truly
says, “To declare war is to suspend not merely <i lang="la">habeas corpus</i>
but the Ten Commandments, and some other good commandments
besides.”<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> That is to say, war is a suspension of a
great part of those rules of morality which, slowly and painfully
formulated by the growing moral consciousness of man,
have become the guide and standard of ordinary conduct. In
war the conscience of the commander is inhibited. “The
commander who lost a battle through the activity of his
moral nature,” once cynically declared United States Senator
Ingalls, “would be the derision and jest of history.”
And that is so. The world has not yet ceased to deride those
Jews who lost their city to the Romans because their consciences
forsooth would not let them fight on the Sabbath day.
War cannot be conducted by the rules of ordinary morality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<p>With a great part of the ordinary moral code suspended,
there is substituted for it a war code every maxim of which
reveals its archaic, vestigial character, stamps it as a survival
from an early savage stage of human development, as a legacy
from a long-past age of the historical evolution when morality
was as yet only an intratribal thing, that is, when men felt
that they owed duties only to members of their own tribe or
social group.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Unfavorable reaction of the ethics of war upon the ethics of peace</div>

<p>In many ways, some obvious and others subtle and hidden,
war works “moral damage” to society, but we here confine
ourselves to emphasizing merely the moral loss and hurt resulting
from the reaction of its low archaic code upon the
more advanced peace code. For, as Professor J. Neville
Figgis justly observes, “It is impossible to remove the very
notion of morality from international affairs without in the
long run undermining it in private life.”<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> What is regarded
as right and proper in war will come to be regarded as right
and proper in peace. That is to say, the maintenance of a
double standard in morals is just as impossible as the maintenance
of a double standard in money. By a sort of Gresham’s
Law the lower standard will drive out the higher or drag it
down to its own low level.</p>

<p>This reaction of the war code upon the ordinary moral code
is well illustrated by what takes place when society metes out
to persons convicted of crime ferocious and barbarous punishments.
In the medieval centuries in Europe when the penalties
for offenses were often fiendishly cruel mutilations of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
body, such as cutting off the ears, the hands, the lips, or the
nose, this judicial procedure was imitated to such a degree by
individuals seeking private vengeance that mayhem, that is,
the mutilation of an enemy by depriving him of a member,
became a crime of such frequent occurrence that it was necessary
to make special and severe enactments against it.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> After
society stopped mutilating the bodies of offenders against its
laws, this offense of mayhem virtually dropped out of the
calendar of private crimes.</p>

<p>In a similar way does the war ethics of the nations react
disastrously upon private morality. The slow moral progress
of European civilization during the last two or three centuries,
compared with its wonderful intellectual and material progress,
may with little hesitation be attributed in large part to
the unfavorable influence of its war ethics upon its everyday
moral code. The war code is applied to politics, to ordinary
business, and to the relations of industrial classes. The politician
as a politician does a hundred things he would not think
of doing as a man, and justifies his acts by appealing to the
adage, “Politics is war.” The business man, citing the like
maxim, “Business is business,” which means that competition
is a species of war and must be conducted on war principles,
flings his Christian code to the winds and, pitilessly pushing
his competitor to the wall, compasses his financial ruin. It is
the same in the struggle between labor and capital. In this
struggle acts of violence, like those of the McNamaras, are
committed, and the persons who do these things absolve
themselves in the forum of their own consciences on the plea
that a state of war exists between capital and labor and that
this justifies the adoption of war methods. Here doubtless
we have the moral psychology of the suffragette movement
in England. Indeed, the leaders of this startling propaganda
tell us frankly that they are waging war, and that this justifies
their suspension of the ordinary rules of conduct. In the light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
of this avowal the alleged inscrutability of their acts disappears.
The movement is simply another illustration of the truth that
so long as nations act under the illusion that they may without
moral wrong employ violence to obtain justice, just so
long will there be individuals who with good conscience will
seek justice through violence.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, these same classes and persons
who thus in various important spheres of activity adopt the
lower standard of war ethics, in all other domains and relationships—in
the family, in the Church, and in social intercourse—act
in accordance with the higher moral code. The
result is a loose synthesis of the two systems, the establishment
of a sort of bi-moral code made up of rules and practices
mutually inconsistent and irreconcilable. The moral
damage resulting from such moral confusion is beyond estimate.
It is the inconsistencies and hypocrisies involved in
such a bi-moral code that is one ground of Nietzsche’s bitter
attack on the ethics of Christendom. Yet, as Professor Figgis
says, “Nietzsche deserves the gratitude of all friends of humanity
for the service he has done in ... showing that the
whole sphere of private life cannot in the long run be different
from the ideals accepted in public affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Obsolescence of war as a school of morals: the war system an anachronism in modern civilization</div>

<p>The arraignment of the war system by the awakening conscience
of the civilized world has led its advocates to lay the
stress of their argument on the moral uses of war. They eulogize
war as the nurse of the sturdy, heroic virtues, and hence
as an indispensable agency in the moral education of the race.
War has, it is true, in past ages been “the supreme theater
of human strenuousness,” and it may be true, as is assumed
by Professor William James in his <i>Moral Equivalent of War</i>,
that the qualities of courage, fortitude, and self-devotion to
common interests were in the beginning evoked and fostered
in the race by war; but whatever may have been the moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
uses of war in the past stages of human development, the time
is past when the war system can serve the highest ends of
civilization. It is an anachronism in the modern world. It
has become a drag upon the moral progress of the race. By
an ethical necessity the day of its abolition approaches. At a
time not remote, as history reckons time, the common conscience
of the world will brand war between civilized nations
as the greatest of crimes, and will regard the nation that
assaults another with intent to commit general slaughter as
a criminal nation—as a common enemy of the human race.
In that coming and better age men will look with the same
incredulous amazement upon our infernal engines and devices
for wholesale man-killing that we of this age look upon
“the iron virgin of Nuremberg” and the other medieval
instruments of torture in the museums of Europe.</p>

<p>To many this optimistic forecast, in the face of the prevailing
war spirit and the ever-growing armaments of the nations,
may seem oversanguine and incredible. But to think despairingly
of the future argues a failure to discern what is really
most significant in the international situation to-day. The
most significant thing in the ongoings of life at Rome on that
memorable day of the year 404 of our era which saw the last
gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum was not that, four hundred
years after the incoming of Christianity with its teachings
of the sanctity of human life, gladiators fought on the arena
to make a holiday for Rome; the significant thing was the
protest made by the Christian monk Telemachus and sealed
by his martyr death,<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a> for that announced the birth into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
Roman world of a new conscience, and that, through an
ethical necessity, meant the speedy abolition of “the human
sacrifices of the amphitheater.”</p>

<p>And so to-day the significant thing is not that nineteen
hundred years after the advent of a religion of peace and
good will among men, gladiator nations still wet the earth
with fratricidal blood; the significant thing is the constantly
growing protest against it all, for that announces the birth into
the modern world of a new international conscience, and
that, through an ethical necessity like that which abolished
forever the bloody sacrifices of the Colosseum, means the
certain and speedy abolition of war as a crass negation of
human solidarity and brotherhood, and a venturous denial of
a moral order of the world and the sovereignty of conscience.</p>

body of the enemy slain in battle because they believe that thereby they
destroy the soul or double and thus secure themselves against its vengeance.
Again the custom grows out of the belief that the virtues of the victim pass
into him who eats the flesh. But the most common motive is the subsistence
motive. Indeed, many of the incessant wars waged by primitive tribes are
nothing more nor less than man-hunting expeditions for securing food.

of many Polynesian tribes were cannibals, for human sacrifices must be
regarded as a sort of celestial cannibalism, when the offering is made in
the belief that the god actually repasts on the blood and the finer essences
of the sacrificial victim. Where men have thus made their gods like unto
themselves, and the practice of cannibalism has been consecrated by religion,
the gods, because religion is always conservative, are certain to remain
anthropophagi much longer than their worshipers. Consequently we find
human sacrifices still lingering on as a kind of survival among peoples, as,
for instance, the Mexicans, who have themselves left far behind the practice
of eating human flesh.</p>

Breasted suggests a connection between the growth of the ideal of an
ethical ordeal in the hereafter with the discontinuance of the building
of immense pyramids. He says: “It is impossible to contemplate the
colossal tombs of the Fourth Dynasty, so well known as the pyramids of
Gizeh, and to contrast them with the comparatively diminutive royal tombs
which follow in the next two dynasties, without ... discerning more than
exclusively political causes behind this sudden and startling change....
The recognition of a judgment and the requirement of moral worthiness
in the hereafter ... marked a transition from reliance on agencies external
to the personality of the dead to dependence on inner values. Immortality
began to make its appeal as a thing achieved in a man’s own soul” (<i>Development

nature of which is revealed by the history of the Children of Israel in Lower
Egypt. The status of the Egyptian serf appears to have been somewhat like
that of the Helots of Laconia in Greece. If we rightly interpret the Biblical
account of the servitude of the Children of Israel, the number of serfs, if
their increase seemed dangerous, was kept down by enforced infanticide
(Ex. i. 7–22).</p>

the reform Pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty, it is true, pursued throughout
his reign a peace policy, but this policy manifestly was dictated by
temperament, or the king’s preoccupation with religious affairs, and not by
moral scruples. His reform was essentially a religious and not a social or
moral one. Not one of the historical documents of the age contains a word
in condemnation of war as inherently wrong (see Breasted, <i>Ancient Records

sovereign Mutsuhito (September 13, 1912), reveals another motive for
suicide which is wholly foreign to our modes of thought and feeling. “In
very early, almost prehistoric, times the custom of <em>jun-shi</em>, or dying with
the master, led to the interment of living Japanese retainers with their dead
lord. The custom gradually died out, but voluntary suicide as a means of
showing personal devotion or attachment to a master or superior persisted
for many centuries” (George Kennan, “The Death of General Nogi,”
New York <i>Outlook</i> for October 5, 1912). It was this ancient custom that
Count Nogi followed. “When all was over”—such is Mr. Kennan’s interpretation

boundless devotion to the man whom he had loved. It was in the spirit of

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_218" href="#FNanchor_218" class="label">218</a> The statement has obtained wide currency that all the banks in Japan
employ only Chinese as cashiers because they cannot find honest Japanese
for these positions of trust. Chinese are sometimes employed in Japanese
banks, but the true reason for their employment is not the one here assigned.
One well qualified to speak authoritatively on this subject says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chinese bankers and cashiers are largely Shansi men, that is, men from the
province of Shansi, where the profession of banking has become hereditary in a
large number of families. They are all, or nearly all, members of the powerful
organization known as the Bankers’ Guild, which has branches in every part of the
Empire. The Bankers’ Guild has discovered that it is practically impossible to conduct
large financial operations without honesty; and it therefore enforces honesty
by means of a discipline that is as rigorous ... as that of the New York Stock
Exchange.... If a Chinese banker breaks faith, violates a contract, or betrays a
trust, he is expelled from his guild and the doors of banks are closed against him for
all time. In the first place, therefore, the Chinese cashier is honest because honesty
is a condition of his business existence. He may not be honest in other respects,—often
he is not,—but he is absolutely honest in the handling of money. In the second
place, he is probably the most expert man living in the rapid calculation of exchanges.
The monetary system of his country is the most confused, chaotic, and complicated
system in the world. There are fifteen or twenty different kinds of taels, no one of
which bears a fixed relation to any other, or to any established monetary standard....
The necessity of dealing in some way with this great mass of unstable and fluctuating
currency and of earning a subsistence from it has made the Chinese cashier one of
the most expert of living accountants. He will solve difficult monetary problems by
short cuts of mental arithmetic, and he calculates exchanges to eight points of decimals.
In the third place, the Chinese cashier counts and manipulates bank bills and
coins with extraordinary skill and accuracy. I have had dealings with him in many
parts of the Far East, but I cannot remember ever to have seen him count a sum of
money twice, and I have never caught him in an error....</p>

<p>Now, when you get a man whose honesty is guaranteed by his guild, whose
manipulation of money is phenomenally dexterous, and who can calculate exchanges
to eight points of decimals, you have an ideal cashier; and if Japanese bankers employ
him, it shows their good business sense rather than their distrust of their own
people. But all Japanese bankers do not employ him. In some of the largest banks
in Tokyo, Kioto, and Osaka there are no Chinese at all—or at least I have never
seen any. This explanation would not be worth, perhaps, the space that I have given
to it, if the story of the Chinese cashier had not been so widely circulated, and if it
were not typical of a whole class of cases in which the Japanese are misjudged
on the basis of a single incident or a solitary fact.—<span class="smcap">George Kennan</span>, “Are the

underlying notion in all religions of which sacrifices form a part. “That
the purpose of sacrifice was simply to feed the gods was admitted on all
sides in the controversy which accompanied the diffusion of Christianity
in the ancient world.... The altar, in the words of Dean Spenser, was
merely the table on which food and drink were set before the languishing
deity” (Payne, <i>History of the New World called America</i> (1892), vol. i,
pp. xi f.). “It is on precisely the same principle that the Mexicans kept
their great war-gods ... alive and vigorous by the blood of young human
victims selected from their tributaries, and the Peruvians maintained the
Creator, Sun, Moon, and Thunder, on whose favor their crops depended,
in youth and vigor by the continual smoke of burnt llamas” (<i>Ibid.</i> vol. i,

divinities of vegetation, which were believed to die and to come to life again,
as with the revolution of the seasons vegetation died and was renewed. Along

world in general. The masses in Buddhist lands have never accepted the
doctrine of Nirvana in the sense of extinction of existence. The following
conversation between Moncure Conway and a Singhalese priest discloses
the meaning of the term to an orthodox Buddhist of Ceylon: “I asked,
‘Have those who are in Nirvana any consciousness?’ I was then informed
that there is no Singhalese word for consciousness. Sumangala said, ‘To
reach Nirvana is to be no more.’ I pointed to a stone step and said, ‘One
is there only as that stone is here?’ ‘Not so much,’ answered the priest;
‘for the stone is actually here, but in Nirvana there is no existence at all’”

for with all other desires suppressed, there remains the desire for
Nirvana. But the difficulty here is only apparent. A Buddhist priest, questioned
respecting this, replied as follows: “The desire for Nirvana escapes
from the mesh that entangles all other desires, because it is not desire for
any object at all” (Conway, <i>My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East</i>
(1906), p. 134). But all other desires aside from this desire for Nirvana are
in a sense sins of covetousness. And this is the cardinal sin in the view of
the true Buddhist, for covetousness “is a strong desire for something, and
all desire is a hindrance in one’s way to Nirvana.”</p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_304" href="#FNanchor_304" class="label">304</a> This dualistic world philosophy is regarded by some students of the
Zend-Avesta as being in the nature of a protest against “the inert asceticism
of Buddhism and the ethical indifference of Brahmanism” (Darmesteter,
“Introduction,” Sacred Books of the East, 2d ed., vol. iv, p. lxviii).
Ranke views it as the product of environment: “If we keep well in view
the contrasts between the various districts and nations included within the
limits of Persia and her provinces, the incessant struggle between the settled
populations and the inhabitants of the steppes, between the cultivated
regions and the desolation of the desert, thrust back, indeed, yet ever
resuming its encroachments, the ideas of the Zend-Avesta will appear to
us natural and, as we may term it, autochthonic” (<i>Universal History</i>, vol. i
(1885), p. 105).</p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_305" href="#FNanchor_305" class="label">305</a> The way in which such a conception acts upon the moral life is well
illustrated in the history of English Puritanism. The ethical strenuousness
of the Puritan was the outcome of his deeply felt consciousness of the
ineradicable antagonism between good and evil. It is all brought vividly
before us in Bunyan’s <i>Holy War</i>, in the struggle between Immanuel and
Diabolus—of which the myth of Ahura and Ahriman was the prototype.</p>

suffering and death the delight of all classes, had spread their brutalising
influence wherever the Roman name was known, had rendered millions
absolutely indifferent to the sight of human suffering, had produced in
many, in the very centre of an advanced civilization, a relish and a passion
for torture, a rapture and an exultation in watching the spasms of extreme
agony, such as an African or an American savage alone can equal”. (<i>History
of European Morals</i>, 3d ed., vol. i, p. 467).</p>

of the best moral and of the most influential, though most chimerical, political
speculations of later ages, and the renewed study of Roman law was an

during these centuries, great advance in theoretical ethics in various domains,
in that of war there was no essential modification of the views and
feelings of the teachers and leaders of moral reforms. In the whole range
of Roman literature and philosophy there are to be found scarcely any
expressions of disapproval of war. The attitude of the Roman moralists
in this matter appears to have been altogether like that of the Greek
philosophers. The right to wage war for empire and for glory was taught
even by Cicero, only such wars, he insisted, should be waged more gently
than wars to recover property, to punish insult, or to avenge a wrong
(<i>De Off.</i> i. 12).</p>

it is possible, in part the outcome of the decay of the ancient city, whose
fancied eternity had satisfied for a time the instinct of immortality. But
when some centuries had passed, the “Romans sailed round the Mediterranean
and recognized that the cities of the past were not eternal, and with
the same waft of conviction came a compensating belief that eternity was
the heritage of every son of man. Immortality arose on the horizon of the
man, as its last glow faded from the city” (Wedgwood, <i>The Moral Ideal</i>,

Torture and mutilation of enemies was sanctioned by the conduct of Samuel against
Agag, of King David against the Philistines, of the men of Judah against Adonibezek.
Even the slaughter of babes in arms was supported by a passage from the
Psalms, “Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the

secularized, that is, divorced from theology, and this with the approval of
most men. Machiavelli would now go farther and separate politics and
morality. This is Lord Morley’s interpretation of <i>The Prince</i>. He thinks
we shall best understand Machiavelli, yet without for a moment approving
his teaching, “if we take him as following up the divorce of politics from
theology, by a divorce from ethics also. He was laying down certain maxims
of government as an art; the end of that art is the security and permanence
of the ruling power; and the fundamental principle from which he silently
started, without shadow of doubt or misgiving as to its soundness, was that
the application of moral standards to this business is as little to the point
as it would be in the navigation of a ship. The effect was fatal even for
his own purpose, for what he put aside, whether for the sake of argument
or because he thought them in substance irrelevant, were nothing less than
the living forces by which societies subsist and governments are strong”

ever-augmenting wrong of private monopoly in land is that presented with
singular force and clarity by Henry George in his epochal work, <i>Progress
and Poverty</i>. His proposal is to exempt from taxation industry and all forms
of property save land, and to lay upon land values, or, in other words, upon
actual or potential ground rents, a tax that would reclaim practically the
whole of these for society, and secure to the public all future increments
in land values created by communal growth and enterprise. Since this tax
is to take the place of all other forms of taxation it has become known as
“the single tax.” Such a change in the tax system would inevitably create
a hardship in a few cases, but a hardship almost infinitesimal as compared
with that now inflicted upon the many by the preëmption of the earth by
a class. The reform would undoubtedly, as claimed by its advocates, destroy
private monopoly in land, the root which nourishes most other monopolies,
and secure to all equal right of access to the earth and its resources.</p>

the spirit of Christ ... than to bring a whole race of people out of sin
and debasement, ... but he soon found that neither minister nor church
anywhere in the lower South continued to protest against slavery; that the
cloth in the North was arrayed against him, and that many northern divines
entered the lists against abolition, especially Moses Stuart, Professor of
Hebrew in Andover Theological Seminary, who justified slavery from the
New Testament; President Lord of Dartmouth College, who held that
slavery was an institution of God, according to natural law; and Hopkins,
Episcopal bishop of Vermont, who came forward as a thick and thin defender
of slavery. The positive opposition of churches soon followed”
(Albert Bushnell Hart, <i>Slavery and Abolition</i> (1906), p. 211). In 1832 took
place the secession of students from Lane Seminary, Cincinnati, because
the trustees and Dr. Lyman Beecher had forbidden them to discuss the
slavery question. Four fifths of the student body withdrew.</p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_770" href="#FNanchor_770" class="label">770</a> The progressive purification of the social conscience may be traced
further in the changed feeling in regard to dueling, lotteries, gambling, and
the use of intoxicating liquors. Less than a century ago dueling was common
among all the European peoples. To-day in all Anglo-Saxon lands
the duel is condemned by the common conscience and prohibited by law.
During the last few decades in the United States lotteries have been transferred
“from the class of respectable to a class of criminal enterprises.”
So too is it the growing moral disapproval of the use of alcoholic drinks
that has caused drunkenness both in England and in our country to become
much less common among the reputable members of society than it was
only two or three generations ago.</p>

Illusion</i> in his contention that there will be no change in the practice of
nations regarding war and preparations for war till there is a change in
ideas respecting the economic advantage to be derived from successful
war. Moral idealism, finding expression in revolutions and reforms, is constantly
giving denial to the validity of the economic or materialistic interpretation
of history when the economic motive is thus made the dominant
motive in human action. War will become a thing of the past only when
men can no longer fight with a good conscience.</p>

a survival of the principle of collective responsibility, which, long outgrown
by ordinary morality, still forms the very basis of the war system. Again,
the true nature of the war code as a heritage from the low level of savagery
is shown in its retention of the primitive rule that the one suffering an
injury shall be the judge of his own cause and the avenger of his wrong,
a principle of self-redress long since discarded by the private law of all
civilized peoples.</p>

of making a protest against the bloody spectacles. “The Romans were
provoked by the interruption of their pleasures; and the rash monk, who
had descended into the arena to separate the gladiators, was overwhelmed
under a shower of stones. But the madness of the people soon subsided;
they respected the memory of Telemachus, who had deserved the honors
of martyrdom; and they submitted without a murmur to the laws of
Honorius, which abolished forever the human sacrifices of the amphitheatre”
